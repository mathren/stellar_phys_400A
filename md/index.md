# 400A Theoretical Astrophysics - Stellar Evolution

Material developed for a one-semester course at the Department of
Astronomy and Steward Observatory of the University of Arizona.

A. Eddington, 1927: *Someday, we should be able to understand something
as simple as a star*

F. Hoyle and R. O. Redman: "*&#x2026;Fundamentally, a star is a pretty
simple structure"* "*You'd look simple too at a distance of ten
parsecs!*"
