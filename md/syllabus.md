# Description of the course

The main topic of the course is stellar structure, a field of
astronomy that brings together many different branches of physics
(hydrodynamics, atomic, nuclear, and neutrino physics,
radiation-matter interactions, etc.) to understand the fundamental
objects of astronomical study: stars.

See also [here](./lectures.md) for a breakdown of the main topics covered and [here](projects.md) for
a tentative list of topics covered by student presentations.

<a id="org44ec220"></a>

# Expected learning outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

-   **Understand the physical scales associated with a wide variety of
    astronomical objects and phenomena.**
-   **Apply a physically motivated theoretical framework to stellar
    structure to derive stellar properties and compare to observations.**
-   **Use mathematical and computational skills to solve astrophysical
    problems related to stars and more generally astrophysics.**
-   **Communicating, translating, and interpreting fundamental
    astronomical concepts and research results.**
-   **Distinguish observationally confirmed elements of stellar physics
    from numerical results.**

These learning outcomes will be met through attendance at lectures,
in-class activities, homework and writing assignments, and a final
literature review project made of written and oral presentation on a
selected topic. See [Projects](./projects.md) for more information, including a list of
possible topics.


<a id="orgd2abf4a"></a>

# Course format and teaching methods

This course relies on frontal lectures, homework, and in-class problem
solving activities (individual and in group), and student
presentations. Some problem solving activities will be of
computational nature.

This is also a class with "writing emphasis", which will be included
as part of homework and the final presentation.


<a id="orgab30afa"></a>

# Recommended textbooks and resources

Most stellar physics text books will contain most of the information
covered in this course, although order and presentation vary. You can
use any textbook you like or already have. I recommend and will mostly
follow these:

-   [Prof. Onno Pols notes](https://www.astro.ru.nl/~onnop/). These lecture notes are freely available,
    accessible, and thorough, making them an excellent starting point.
    I strongly suggest downloading a copy for yourself early in the
    course.
-   [Kippenhahn, Weigert, & Weiss 2012](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-30304-3). This is a classic textbook that
    you may continue to consult even as a seasoned researcher with
    emphasis on the physical processes in stars. If you are an enrolled
    student and have troubles accessing this book, please come talk to
    me.

We will also use [MESA-web](http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-submit), a cloud-computing resource to run stellar
evolution simulations with the open-source, community-developed, code
[MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/).


<a id="org76904df"></a>

# Exams and grading

The course grade will be based on:

-   In class participation: 20%
-   Homework: 40%
-   Literature review project/presentation (written+oral): 40%

The class will not be curved, and this will be the correspondence
between final percentages and letter grades:

-   A: 85-100%
-   B: 70-85%
-   C: 50-70%
-   D: 30-50%
-   E: 0-30%


<a id="orga7b477e"></a>

## Participation

Your engagement, quality of contributions, and interactions with the
instructors and with your peers will contribute to your final grade.
Quality and frequency of your contributions will be evaluated
throughout the course, rewarding specifically **growth** and **improvement**.

**N.B.:** I will not log attendance, being there is **not a sufficient**
condition to guarantee a good participation grade.


<a id="org4aeb153"></a>

### Rubric for in class participation

The rubric used to evaluate the in class participation is given below.
I will keep track of relevant and/or insightful questions/comments in

</table>

Roughly between one-third and halfway through the course, depending
on how lectures proceed, you will receive feedback on
your participation in class.


<a id="orgdba8576"></a>

## Homework

There will be regular homework assignments, including
order-of-magnitude, quantitative, computational and/or more
qualitative exercises, depending on the week and topic. Please feel
free to use resources outside of the textbook. You can also
collaborate with your peers, but please **each time you do, indicate
with whom**. You **must** show your individual work to receive full credit.

Assignments should be uploaded **in pdf form** via D2L. Deadlines will be
designed to use the homework materials in class. **Late submissions will
not be accepted unless explicitly agreed upon beforehand**, if you
expect not to make it on time, ask for an extension **at least one day
before the deadline**. It's better to submit something incomplete than
nothing. In your pdf files, you should show the calculations done and
contextualise them as appropriate.

Timely feedback will be provided for you to assess your understanding
and progress.


<a id="org082e8d9"></a>

## Literature review project and presentation

You will be assigned a topic relevant to the course to explain to your
peers. You will search the literature and prepare a written text plus
an oral presentation. The written text will be evaluated both by the
instructor and two randomly selected peers, the oral presentation will
be evaluated by all the student present plus the instructors. For more
information on the literature review project/presentation and how it
will be graded, see [here](./projects.md).


<a id="org2541115"></a>

## Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):

Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in
accordance with University policies, which are available at
<https://registrar.arizona.edu/faculty-staff-resources/grading/grading-policies/incomplete>
and
<https://registrar.arizona.edu/faculty-staff-resources/grading/grading-policies/withdrawals>,
respectively.


<a id="orgb6778f8"></a>

# Classroom Behavior

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors
have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive
environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where
we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on
the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting,
chatting, web surfing, etc.). Students are asked to refrain from
disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during
lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be
asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class
will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to
the Dean of Students.

The Arizona Board of Regents’ Student Code of Conduct, ABOR Policy
5‐308, prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the
University community, including to one’s self. See:
<http://policy.web.arizona.edu/threatening‐behavior‐students>

Any social media groups generated using university-sponsored tools
(e.g., D2L class lists, slack workspaces) should be treated as an
extension of the classroom. This means that they will need to abide by
the University’s student code of conduct policies, and be respectful,
inclusive environments.


<a id="org3beadbd"></a>

## Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy

The University of Arizona is committed to creating and maintaining an
environment free of discrimination. In support of this commitment, the
University prohibits discrimination, including harassment and
retaliation, based on a protected classification, including race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran
status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or genetic information.
For more information, including how to report a concern, please see
<http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy>


<a id="org4464b4c"></a>

## Accessibility and accommodations

At the University of Arizona, we strive to make learning
experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or
experience barriers based on disability or pregnancy, please
contact the Disability Resource Center (520-621-3268,
<https://drc.arizona.edu/>) to establish reasonable accommodations.


<a id="orgaf554cf"></a>

## Class recordings

To facilitate everyone's participation, audio and/or video recording
of in class activities is not allowed unless explicitly agreed upon by
all present students *and* instructors. In no case sharing on public
platforms of the recordings will be allowed.


<a id="org9347e48"></a>

## Preferred Name and Pronoun

This course affirms people of all gender expressions and gender
identities. If you prefer to be called a different name than what is
on the class roster, please let me know. Feel free to correct
instructors on your preferred gender pronoun.


<a id="org0aa1093"></a>

# Attendance Policy

All holidays or special events observed by organized religions will be
honored for those students who show affiliation with that particular
religion. Absences pre‐approved by the UA Dean of Students (or Dean's
designee) will be honored.

It is important to attend all classes, as what is discussed in class
is pertinent to adequate performance on assignments and exams. If you
must be absent, it is your responsibility to obtain and review the
information you missed.


<a id="org517df95"></a>

# Academic Integrity

Integrity is expected of every student in all academic work. The
guiding principle of academic integrity is that a student’s submitted
work must be the student’s own. Students are encouraged to share
intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications
of course materials. However, **graded work/exercises must be the
product of your own effort unless otherwise instructed**. Students are
expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described
in the UA General Catalog. See:
<https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/student-rights-responsibilities/academic-integrity>

Misappropriation of exams before or after they are given will be
considered academic misconduct. Misconduct of any kind will be
prosecuted and may result in any or all of the following:

-   Reduction of grade
-   Failing grade
-   Referral to the Dean of Students for consideration of additional
    penalty, i.e. notation on a student’s transcript re. academic
    integrity violation, etc. <http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/policies‐and‐codes/code‐academic‐integrity>
