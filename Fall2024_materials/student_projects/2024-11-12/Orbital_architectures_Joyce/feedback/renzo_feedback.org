Hi Thomas,

thank you for your timely submission and thorough work, which as you
can tell was also appreciated by your referees.

The assignment was open-ended on purpose, but my biggest suggestion
here would be to *define orbital architecture* and for the oral part of
your presentation, try to tie it to the scope of the course: the
initial part of your written presentation focuses on satellites orbits
around the Earth. I suggest expanding on the second part on stellar
orbits around other stars in the oral presentation.

Bests,
Mathieu
