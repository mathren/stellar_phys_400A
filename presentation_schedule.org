* Presentation assigned topics, reviewers, and schedule

This is the planned schedule, with dates, topics and referees.

Because of the high popularity of some proposed topics and very uneven
distribution of preferences it was /impossible/ to accommodate everyone.

Dates are chosen to group topics by theme, and avoid having to both
present and referee the same day. If you know you cannot present on
the assigned day (or if you know you cannot referee in the week
preceding the date of the presentation on the topic you have been
assigned), please /let me know as soon as possible/.

Adjustments to the schedule are still possible in the coming week, but
will not be possible afterwards. Barring very exceptional
circumstances, not presenting on the scheduled day and not providing
feedback on the deadlines will not be excused.

*N.B.:* Having exams of other classes will not count as exceptional
circumstance, I am making the schedule available as early as possible
so you can organize yourself

*In the list below, you should find your name 3 times: once as
presenter and twice as referee.*

** Reminders

 - the aim is for you to review, summarize, and explain to your peers
   some topic we cannot cover: you want to teach the others what you
   learned!
 - it is *strongly* advised to check your sources and plan with TA and
   me before starting to write your written document.
 - *written summary due one week (7 days) before the oral
   presentation* is scheduled
 - referees (+myself and TA) to provide feedback within 3 working days
   after the reception of the written summary
 - no revision of the written summary is required, but you can incorporate the feedback in your oral presentation
 - oral presentations on the day scheduled should be 10 minutes-long
   (+ 5 minutes of Q&A). The class will be grading the presentation.
