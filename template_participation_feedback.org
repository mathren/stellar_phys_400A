#+title: Mid-course participation feedback template emails
#+author: [[mrenzo@arizona.edu][Mathieu Renzo]]

Roughly half-way through the course I divide the students in three
tiers based on their participation so far and send each tier some
variation of the emails below to encourage continuing or stimulate
more participation.

* Top-tier
Subject: Mid-course Participation Feedback - Keep up the good work!

I wanted to reach out and express my appreciation for your engagement
in class and/or office hours so far. Your consistent level of
engagement, thoughtful questions, and insights have contributed to
making lectures more dynamic and interesting. It's clear that you come
prepared and think critically about the materials. Keep up this great
level of engagement!

Best regards,


* Mid-tier
Subject: Mid-course Participation Feedback - We'd love to hear more from you!

I'm reaching out regarding your participation in our class discussions
this semester. I notice that you've been quite reserved during our
lectures, and I wanted to encourage you to share your thoughts and
questions more openly. Please remember that active participation is an
important part of the learning process, and your perspective is
valuable to your peers and to me. There are no "wrong" questions – in
fact, questions you have might help clarify concepts for others as
well. If you feel hesitant about speaking up, I'm happy to discuss
strategies to help you feel more comfortable participating in class.
If there are any specific concerns or barriers that are holding you
back from participating more actively, please don't hesitate to meet
with me during office hours to discuss them.

Best regards,


* Bottom-tier

Subject: Mid-course Participation Feedback - Your contributions matter!

I'm writing to thank you for your contributions to the course so far.
When you participate, your insights add value to our conversations. I
would love to hear even more from you during our lectures, as I
believe you have valuable perspectives to share and insightful
questions. Please feel free to voice your thoughts and questions more
frequently – your contributions help create a richer learning
environment for everyone. If you feel hesitant about speaking up, I'm
happy to discuss strategies to help you feel more comfortable
participating in class. If there are any specific concerns or barriers
that are holding you back from participating more actively, please
don't hesitate to meet with me during office hours to discuss them.

Best regards,
