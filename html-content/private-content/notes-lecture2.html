</figure>

<p>
This is an example of an observational color-magnitude diagram from
the second <i>Gaia</i> data release, <i>Gaia</i> DR2 in 2018. <i>Gaia</i> is an ESA space
mission to detect with great accuracy parallax and proper motion of &gt;1
billion stars in the Galaxy. This is a very "classical" astrophysics
task, but the precision and size of the datasets from this mission are
unprecedented and are revolutionizing this field.
</p>

<p>
The x-axis is the color, obtained as the difference in flux between
two filters of the <i>Gaia</i> telescope <code>Bp-Rp</code>.
</p>

<p>
The y-axis is the magnitude in the <code>G</code> band of the telescope.
</p>

<p>
Each dot is a different star, but there are so many, that in the most
crowded region what is plotted is the density of stars (per unit
"pixel" on this plot). So what we are looking at is a group picture of
many different stars, varying in age, composition, position in the
galaxy, etc.

The figure above shows on the right y-axis and top x-axis the
quantities that typically stellar modelers use, effective temperature
(T<sub>eff</sub>) on the x-axis and luminosity L on the y-axis.
</p>

<p>
The effective temperature is defined as the temperature of a
black-body with the same energy flux as the surface of the star, such
that L=4&pi; R<sup>2</sup>T<sub>eff</sub><sup>4</sup>.
</p>

<p>
with R the radius of the star. Therefore, T<sub>eff</sub> is an idealization: the
stellar surface actually does not have a sharp cutoff with a well
defined radius R and temperature T<sub>eff</sub>. Instead, as one moves outward
in the stellar atmosphere, progressively the gas becomes transparent
to different wavelength &lambda; of light: in reality there is a different
radius for each wavelength at which one can observe a star: R &equiv; R(&lambda;).
This is the topic of the stellar atmosphere, which determines the
outer-boundary conditions we need to study the interior. Throughout
the atmosphere, there will be a location where T = T<sub>eff</sub>, but there is
nothing physically special occurring there! However, from the interior
point-of-view, it is useful to determine at this idealized location
the outer boundary. We can then specify there the outer boundary
condition to solve the stellar structure equations, which you don't
know yet &#x2013; but we will derive and write down during this course.
</p>

<p>
We can then use these same axes to plot not a collection of different
stars at a given point in time, like in the plot from <i>Gaia</i> above, but
instead if we have a model of how a star evolves (which is what we
want to develop in this course), then we can plot one star as a
function of time! This is necessarily a "theoretical" plot: stellar
timescales are typically so long, that one human life is not
sufficient to observe a star moving through such a plot.
</p>

<p>
The following is an example of HR diagram for a 15M<sub>o</sub> star from
zero age main sequence (roughly when most of its luminosity is
provided by Hydrogen burning in the core) to the onset of
core-collapse and thus the point where it will go supernova

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org70e274e">
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsS80huL47c">This video</a> shows how <i>HST</i> observations of the Globular cluster &Omega;
Centauri can be sorted in color and magnitude to create&#x2026;a
color-magnitude diagram, where all the stars end up along an
isochrone.
</p>

<p>
An <b>isochrone</b> (from iso = "same" + chronos = "time") is the locus of
points occupied by a population of different stars at a given time.
Typically these are used in analyzing clusters, which are in first
approximation co-eval population of stars with the same composition.
Fitting theoretical isochrones (obtained combining many stellar
models of individual stars) is one of the ways in which one can
determine the age of a cluster.
</p>

<p>
Note that in the first color-magnitude diagram shown above from <i>Gaia</i>
DR2 there are no isochrones: that diagram represents all stars
observed across the Galaxy in <i>Gaia</i> DR2, they have very different ages
from each other, and that's why isochrones there would not be very
informative.
</p>

<p>
Typically isochrones are used on the color-magnitude diagram, but
nothing forbids one to make isochrones on other planes.

<p>
Make your own color-magnitude diagram of a selected group of stars.
This is a data-visualization exercise, so try to make your diagram as
informative and useful as possible. Think of a publication-quality
plot, you want it to be good looking for people to want to use it in
their slides, dense in information, and the info should possibly be
layered. You will also need to write a brief paragraph of description
of what is plotted, including the source of data.

We will use the latest data release from ESA's <i>Gaia</i> mission, you will
be using a bleeding-edge dataset! These are publicly available in the
<a href="https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/">Gaia archive</a> or any of the <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/data-access#PartnerDataCentres">partner data centers</a>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to <a href="https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/">https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/</a> and select the "Search tab"</li>
<li>Select the <i>Gaia</i> query you want to make. Feel free to experiment,
but keep in mind that you will need to briefly explain what it is
you plot.</li>
<li>Download and clean the data. Make sure you start with a manageable
amount. If you want to select a cluster, you may need to do
parallax cuts.</li>
<li>Plot the color-magnitude diagram (suggestion: G-band magnitude on
the y-axis, BP-RP color on the x-axis)</li>
<li>download and plot a bunch of Gaia data. Make the visualization as
clear as possible</li>
