<p>
My name is Mathieu Renzo, I have been an assistant professor here at
Steward since last year. Before, I was a postdoc in New York city (at
the Flatiron institute and Columbia University), and before that I did
my PhD at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands &#x2013; but I am
originally from none of these places!
</p>

<p>
The topic of this course is stellar evolution, which is my research
field. More specifically, I work on the evolution of massive stars in
binary systems. These are the stars that end their lives in <i>supernova
explosions</i>, that can outshine briefly an entire galaxy. During these
explosions some of the most exotic objects in the universe are formed,
neutron stars or black holes (especially if the explosion fails!). The
massive star progenitor of these objects are found most often in
binary systems, meaning there are two stars orbiting each other, and
they can, as they evolve, interact and exchange mass and sometimes
merge. My research is strongly embedded in the topic of this course
(stellar evolution) and touches on explosion physics, X-ray binaries,
gravitational waves, etc. I will try to connect the course material to
all these topics whenever possible!
</p>

<p>
Also, my research field (and more broadly the scientific topic of this
course) is <i>very computationally oriented</i>. Throughout the course, I
will try to highlight what is the result of computer models based on
necessary (but often grossly oversimplifying) approximations and what
is more solidly grounded in observations. We will do this by having
computational exercises, that's why I asked about your confidence in
your ability to make plots in the survey. We will start the course by
going over the physical foundations, but I will also ask you to use your
own computer models too.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org594811f">
<p>
This is a core course during your 4<sup>th</sup> year, so you are approaching the
academic threshold beyond which you will be <b>expected</b> to carry out
independent work (either in your thesis, in the future as graduate
students or highly skilled professionals).
</p>

<p>
My idea for this course is to not only provide <i>content</i> regarding
stellar physics and evolution, but also to help you develop skills as
independent researchers for your future (whether in academia or
elsewhere).
</p>

<p>
For this reason also <i>I will not check your attendance</i>. However,
during the lectures I will present things in a way that complements
the textbook(s), and you will more likely have a better understanding
if you attend. Also, as we'll discuss in a moment, in-class
participation will count for up to 20% of your final grade, so if you
want more than a B you should come <b>and actively participate</b>.
</p>

<p>
An important thing to keep in mind as we go through the semester is to
have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_and_growth_mindsets">growth mindset</a>: we are all here to learn and improve ourselves!
Grading will particularly reward improvement, so a failure at some
point (of one homework) is just an opportunity for improvement &#x2013; not
a career stopping tragedy.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, I expect everyone in the class to treat each other with
respect and kindness. We don't all come from the same background, we
don't all need to be at the same exact level to learn from each other.
Ultimately, you are here to learn some science and <i>science is a team
effort</i>. It has been proven many times over that diverse teams achieve
better results. Start practicing this now: if someone is struggling
with some material that you think you have under control, help them.
They are not slowing you down, but giving you an opportunity to verify
and deepen your knowledge by engaging with them and the difficulties
they may be experiencing. You may soon be the one in difficulty
yourself and give them a chance to "repay". In the end we will
all be better thanks to this dynamics.
</p>

<p>
Stellar evolution is also a very vast topic, and there is too much to
cover in only one semester, with many bleeding edge developments. So I
will ask <b>you</b> to teach your peers some of the topics that don't fit
within the main part of the course. You will also evaluate (and be
evaluated) by your peers. This is because the ability of giving
constructive and helpful feedback is important in science and beyond:
you will work with others and need to help them improve, and you will
receive feedback yourselves for the rest of your careers whatever they
may be. We will do this through a project, that we will discuss later.

<p>
Note that the requirement of nuclear fusion is <b>extremely new</b>: only
about 100 years old! A lot can be learned about stars without knowing
anything about nuclear fusion, which we will treat, but much later in
the course.

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> Definitions often try to "pidgeon-hole" nature into specific
categories, but often nature is more elusive. In the case of the
"modern" definition of star above, there is the boundary case of Brown
Dwarfs, which are self-gravitating amount of gas that early in their
life may do some deuterium burning. This burning does not release a
lot of energy (the deuterium nucleus, a proton and a neutron bound
together, has very low nuclear binding energy), thus these objects sit
at the boundary between planets and stars.

<p>
In astrophysics (and in stellar physics in particular) we still use
quantities and units that have mostly a historical justification (one
could say for "backward compatibility" to borrow software development
language).
</p>

<p>
The yearly apparent motion on the sky of stars (w.r.t. to farther
stars that are too far to exhibit this behavior) due to the orbit of
the Earth around the Sun is called <i>parallax</i>. A commonly used unit of
distance in astronomy is the <i>parsec</i> = distance of a star with a
parallax of one arcsecond:
</p>

<p>
1 pc &cong; 3&times;10<sup>18</sup>cm &cong; 2 &times; 10<sup>5</sup> AU &cong; 3 light years
</p>

<p>
This is a measure of distance that can be used for stars
with relatively small distances to the Solar system.

<h4 id="org39b7352"><a href="#org39b7352">Proper motion and radial velocity</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org39b7352">
<p>
We can also see how stars move in the sky, but we need two different
techniques to measure the velocity <i>on the plane of the sky</i> (so called
proper motion), and <i>towards</i> or <i>away</i> from us (so called "radial
velocity", as in the radial direction in a sphere centered on the
observer).
</p>

<p>
But even before considering those, we need to remove all the apparent
motions due to the Earth rotation:
</p>


<figure id="org028bd77">
<img src="./images/night_rotation.jpg" alt="night_rotation.jpg" width="100%">

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Long exposure picture showing circular tracks along the north direction. These are just the reflected motion due to the rotation of the Earth. Note the stars have different colors! Credits: G. Inchingolo.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
We also have to remove the apparent motion due to the orbit of the
Earth around the Sun, and the motion of the Sun and solar system
across the Galaxy (which includes a component of "peculiar motion",
that is a deviation from the galactic rotation curve).
</p>

<p>
Once all that cleaning is done, we can see the intrinsic projected
motion of a star on the sky, so called <i>proper motion</i> (sometimes
indicated with &mu; or pm). All that requires is a long timeline (since &mu;
&cong; arcsin((v<sub>&parallel;</sub> &times; &Delta; t)/d) with v<sub>&parallel;</sub> transverse
velocity (i.e., on the plane of the sky), &Delta; t time baseline and d
distance of the star, and a reference frame.
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> The proper motion is an <i>angle on the plane of the sky per unit
time</i>. Converting proper motions to physical velocity requires knowing
the distance d, which is usually hard! Moreover, d is very large
typically (d &Gt; 1 pc), so measuring &mu; requires long time baselines and
very accurate instruments.
</p>

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>Schematic representation of the proper motion</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
For the motion orthogonal to the plane of the sky, that is the motion
away/towards the observer, that is the so called <i>radial velocity</i> (RV)
through the Doppler shift of spectral lines (we will talk more about
these later in the course). These sometimes can be periodic and thus
caused by either pulsations of the stellar atmosphere or Keplerian
orbital motion around a (possibly unseen) companion star, or they can
be constant (on timescales much shorter than the period of the orbit
of the star around the Galactic center) and thus reveal intrinsic
motion. In general, one does not look at just one spectral line, but a
"series" of lines (e.g., the series coming from all the transitions of
electrons across energy levels of a specific ion).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb388a56">
<p>
The magnitude scale is a logarithmic scale first introduces by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a>, who clearly was only able to do naked-eye observations.
This explains why a logarithmic scale: the sensory responses are often
logarithmic (see <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law">Weber-Fechner's law</a>). The magnitude scale was
formalized by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1856MNRAS..17...12P/abstract">Pogson 1856</a>.
</p>

<p>
The magnitudes measure the energy flux from a point-like source (like
a distant star) and it is a differential measure relative to some
standard source. Hipparchus was comparing the visual brightness of
various stars visible in the sky. This is still the basis of (some)
magnitude systems. In reality. typically magnitudes are provided
integrating over a range of frequencies (photometry!) accounting for
the response of a filter as a function of wavelength T(&lambda;):
</p>

<div class="latex" id="orgc3ab411">
\begin{equation}
m = -2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{\int T(\lambda)F_{\lambda}d\lambda}{\int T(\lambda) d\lambda}\right) + m_{0} \ \ ,
\end{equation}

</div>

<p>
where m<sub>0</sub> is the reference magnitude, F<sub>&lambda;</sub> is the monochromatic
flux of the source, and the factor of -2.5 is chosen so that the
magnitudes measured this way roughly agree with Hipparchus'.
<i>An increase of 5 magnitudes corresponds to an increase in flux
of a factor of 100</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>bolometric</i> magnitude is the magnitude across all wavelengths for
an idealized perfect detector (T(&lambda;) = 1 &forall; &lambda;). If the distance of a
source is known, we can then infer its intrinsic luminosity from this.
</p>

<p>
The <i>apparent</i> magnitude m we just defined is a measure of the actual
photon flux received from a source (e.g., a star) on Earth, but that
of course depends on how far the source is from Earth (a candle in
your hand has a higher apparent magnitude than Betelgeuse in the
sky!). Therefore, astronomer also introduced the <i>absolute</i> magnitude as
the apparent magnitude a star would have if it were at a distance of
10pc from the Sun, thus the relation between apparent magnitude m and
absolute magnitude M is
</p>

<div class="latex" id="org4cab525">
\begin{equation}\label{eq:abs_magn}
M - m = -2.5\log_{10}\left[\left(\frac{d}{10\mathrm{pc}}\right)^{2}\right] \ \,
\end{equation}

</div>

<p>
where d is the distance, and it is assumed there is no absorption of
light by the interstellar material.
</p>

<p>
For the reference magnitude m<sub>0</sub> there are multiple choices (and there
are many different magnitude systems because of the T(&lambda;) and m<sub>0</sub>
choices!). For instance, typically the star Vega (&alpha; Lyrae) is used as
a standard and by definition its magnitude in U, B, and V band in the
Vega-based magnitude system is zero. So for magnitude M=0 we have a
specific (i.e., per unit frequency) radiative energy flux of 3.5&times;10<sup>-20</sup>
erg cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> Hz<sup>-1</sup> corresponding to a photon flux of N<sub>&lambda;</sub> &cong;
10<sup>3</sup> photons cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> Å<sup>-1</sup> for the visual band.

stellar interior - and above which there is a net radial flux of
photons - that is the stellar atmosphere (but photons can still move
around in any direction, it's just on average there are more moving in
the positive r direction). Stars don't really have a well defined

The "metallicity" is the fraction by mass of gas that is <i>not</i> hydrogen

chemist would not call "metals". See <a href="https://webelements.com/">here</a> for an online periodic table
of elements.
</p>

<p>
Often, for lack of better knowledge available, we assume that the
distribution of metals scales with the Solar distribution, sometimes
allowing for enhancement of &alpha; particles (e.g., carbon, oxygen, neon,
and all other elements that can approximately be thought of as N &alpha;
particles bound together where &alpha; particle = nucleus of helium 4).

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Projects will cover topics that are important and or timely, but
hard to fit in the main body of the course</li>
<li>Occasion for you to dig deeper and teach to your peers</li>
<li>You should look over the <a href="projects.html#org297810e">proposed project</a>, and give us a ranked list
of 5 projects you'd like to do (see <a href="https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/1463376">D2L</a> for updated deadline).</li>
<li>After receiving your preferences, we will assign to each a project
trying to maximize happiness (though it may not be possible to
accommodate everyone), and for each project we will assign two peer
referees.</li>
<li>Look over also <a href="projects.html#orgb65bc69">how the grading of the project will work</a>: in short,
we will evaluate your written summary (together with 2 of your
classmates!), your oral presentation in class (again, with your
peers!), and how you give feedback to others.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org692bcb0">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As per the syllabus, homework should be your own production,
though you can discuss with your peers. Science is made of
collaborations, but you are expected to be able to do all the
homeworks yourself.</li>
<li>Always consult <a href="https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/1463376">D2L</a> for official deadlines. If you need an
extension, it should be agreed upon at least <b>one day before the
official deadline</b>.</li>
<li>Throughout the course the typology of exercises and difficulty
will vary. This is normal also when doing research: not every task
is as easy/as hard as the next. If you encounter difficulties,
keep in mind that it's only an opportunity to grow and improve!</li>

provide a ranked list of 5 preferences. Feel free to search
the web/literature to decide. Based on this list, I will try to
assign projects and peer-referees, but it may not be possible to
satisfy everyone. If you want, feel free to come up with different
subjects related to stellar physics as well to propose, but you need
to talk to me to get them approved before they can be on your list!</li>
