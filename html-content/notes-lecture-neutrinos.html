<h3 id="org593af7f"><a href="#org593af7f">Two types of neutrinos</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org593af7f">
<p>
For the density typical in stellar interior (think of &lang;&rho;<sub>☉</sub>&rang; and the other
average densities you estimated in the various homeworks), neutrinos
can safely be considered as non-interacting. This means we can
consider neutrinos as ultra-relativistic mass-less particles
propagating at v &cong; c. The mass less approximation also implies that we
neglect neutrino oscillations: even if a neutrino changes leptonic
flavor, it's still going to leave the star carrying away its energy!
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> recall that the leptonic number is +1 for the leptons electron
e<sup>-</sup>, muon &mu;<sup>-</sup>, tau &tau;<sup>-</sup> and the corresponding neutrinos &nu;<sub>e</sub>, &nu;<sub>&mu;</sub>,
&nu;<sub>&tau;</sub> and -1 for their antiparticles positron e<sup>+</sup>, positive muon &mu;<sup>+</sup>,
and positive &tau;<sup>+</sup> and the corresponding antineutrinos.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, any neutrino produced in the stellar interior leaves the
star in the light-crossing time R/c &le; 1000 R<sub>☉</sub>/c &cong; 1000 &times;
2 sec = 2000 sec which is much shorter than evolutionary timescales
(and even during shorter evolutionary phases such as silicon shell
burning, the energy carried by the neutrinos is on its way out and
nothing is going to stop it from leaving the star).
</p>

<p>
These arguments apply to both kinds of neutrinos that we encounter in
stellar evolution (and are about to introduce), and stop working only
when densities get extremely high (&rho;&ge;10<sup>10</sup> g cm<sup>-3</sup>): at this point
neutrinos can and do start interacting with matter. Such densities are
only encountered in a collapsing core that has exhausted nuclear fuel
and in neutron stars: neutrino interactions are crucial to the physics
of the supernova explosions, but can safely be neglected before.
</p>

<p>
During the evolution of the star that sets the stage for the
explosion, we encounter two "classes" of neutrinos.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbc9ba2b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgbc9ba2b"><a href="#orgbc9ba2b">Nuclear neutrinos</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbc9ba2b">
<p>
We have already encountered processes producing neutrinos occurring in
stars: <i>weak nuclear reactions</i>! These are needed since the main
sequence (both in the pp chain and CNO) to convert some protons into
neutrons for the helium nuclei. On the scale of r<sub>nuc</sub>, the neutrino
crossing time (that is the light crossing time) is so short that we
can neglect neutrino oscillations and assume conservation of leptonic
number to write down the equations.
</p>

<p>
These neutrinos do carry away energy as described above, <i>but</i> that is
just some of the energy that the exo-energetic thermonuclear reaction
would have released. Effectively, they decrease the energy gain from
releasing nuclear binding energy but they are not a net energy loss.
</p>

<p>
This allows to incorporate them in models by re-writing &epsilon;<sub>nuc</sub>
&rarr; &epsilon;<sub>nuc</sub> - |&epsilon;<sub>&nu;, nuc</sub>|, where the neutrino term is always negative
(hence we can write it as minus an absolute value), and needs to be
calculated from nuclear physics, determining the spectrum of the
neutrino produced by a given reaction (a non-trivial task which
stellar physics leaves to neutrinos and nuclear physicists).
</p>

<p>
Particularly important for the late evolution of massive stars are
neutrinos from the so-called <i>URCA processes</i> (named after a casino in
Rio de Janeiro because when these processes kick in the energy of the
nuclear reaction goes the same way as the money in the casino!):
</p>
<div class="latex" id="org7d475c1">
\begin{equation}
 ^{A}Z+e^{-}\rightarrow^{A}(Z-1) + \nu_{e  }\\
 ^{A}(Z-1)\rightarrow ^{A}Z+ e^{+} +\bar{\nu_{e}}
\end{equation}

</div>

<p>
which produce one neutrino and one anti-neutrino without changing the
composition of the star. This requires that the nucleus \(^{A}(Z-1)\) is
unstable to &beta;<sup>-</sup>-decay and the cross section for electron capture on
\(^AZ\) is non-negligible, which can happen during Si core burning and
the subsequent gravitational collapse of the core once the nuclear
fuel runs out.
</p>

<p>
The nuclear neutrinos are mostly sensitive to the core temperature for
the activation of certain thermonuclear reaction chains (except for
pycno-nuclear reaction at extremely high densities where the electron
screening effectively makes the Coulomb barrier negligible).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org69adb98" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org69adb98"><a href="#org69adb98">Thermal neutrinos</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org69adb98">
<p>
After helium core burning, the density in the stellar cores become
sufficiently high (because of the gravothermal collapse) that
non-nuclear processes producing neutrinos start occurring. After
carbon depletion, the neutrinos produced by these processes can take
away more energy than is locally lost to photons by each stellar
layer: <i>evolved massive stars are neutrino stars</i> L<sub>&nu;</sub>
&Gt; L<sub>rad</sub> (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1968Ap%26SS...2...96F/abstract">Fraley 1968</a>).

</figure>


<p>
This also effectively means that the stellar core of evolved (&sim; during
and after carbon core burning) massive stars is <i>decoupled</i> from the
stellar envelope: the <i>gravothermal collapse of the core occurs to
compensate the neutrino losses from the core itself</i>! The thermal
timescale of the core becomes &tau;<sub>KH,&nu;</sub>&cong; GM<sub>core</sub><sup>2</sup>/(2R<sub>core</sub> L<sub>&nu;</sub>) and
the nuclear timescale becomes &tau;<sub>nuc,&nu;</sub> = &phi; f<sub>burn</sub> Mc<sup>2</sup>/L<sub>&nu;</sub> both of which
are much shorter than the timescales in the low density, photon-cooled
envelope: in the late stages of stellar evolution the envelope should
be <i>frozen</i> and the core evolves driven by neutrino losses.
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> it is still the energy losses driving the gravothermal collapse
because of the virial theorem that govern the evolution, but the
envelope does not have time to keep up with the core.
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> recently, observations of early signals of stellar explosion
have questioned this picture of <i>frozen</i> envelope: there <i>may</i> be some
presently unknown phenomena happening on a <i>dynamical</i> timescale of the
envelope in the final years/months of a massive star evolution that
affect the envelope. The fact that they <i>need to be dynamical</i> to do
anything is related to the fact that the evolution of the core is sped
up by the thermal neutrino losses.
</p>

<p>
The neutrinos that do <i>not</i> come from nuclear reactions are a real
energy <i>loss</i> term for the star that enter in the local energy
conservation equation &epsilon;<sub>&nu;</sub> (which is also always negative!): dL/dm =
&epsilon;<sub>nuc</sub> - |&epsilon;<sub>&nu;</sub>| +&epsilon;<sub>grav</sub>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>thermal</i> processes producing these neutrinos typically will produce
a neutrino-antineutrino <i>pair</i> to conserve the leptonic number.
Typically only electron neutrinos will be relevant: leptons other than
e<sup>&plusmn;</sup> are unstable and are not commonly found in stars. They fall into
several categories (here x={e,&mu;, or &tau;} but in stellar conditions it's
typically e):

Neutrino cooling processes are mostly sensitive to the core density &rho;.

"<i>Traditional scientific knowledge has generally taken the form of</i>
<i>either theory or experimental data. However, where theory and</i>
<i>experiment stumble, simulations may offer a third way.</i>" - Simulation,
Johannes Lenhard et al.
</p>

<p>
We now have finally derived/discussed all the pieces of physics
necessary to compute a stellar <i>structure</i> model, treat its nuclear
energy generation and thus driving its <i>evolution</i>.
</p>

<p>
The description we have obtained for a spherically symmetric star is
made of <b>four non-linear, coupled, ordinary differential equations</b>
(ODE) <b>plus the equation of state that acts as closure condition</b> for
the system. Solving these equations we can:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>study the interior structure of modelled stars and try to learn about
the parts of the star that are not accessible to direct
observations (hidden inside the photosphere)</li>
<li>study the time evolution of modelled stars, which we cannot
observe for real stars since most evolve way too slow for us to
follow within our lifetimes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
However, this system of coupled, non-linear ODEs is not easily solved
by hand. Since the early days of the availability of computers in the
1960s, people have been designing and leveraging <i>computational
techniques</i> to <i>numerically</i> solve this system of equations (see e.g.,
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1959ApJ...129..628H/abstract">Henyey 1959</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962ApJ...135..770I/abstract">Iben &amp; Erhman 1962</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1970ApJ...159..619S/abstract">Sujimoto 1970</a> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1971MNRAS.151..351E/abstract">Eggleton 1971</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978ApJ...225.1021W/abstract">Weaver
et al. 1978</a>). For the rest of this lecture, we are going to discuss
some general principles behind these computational techniques.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3b80b37" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3b80b37"><a href="#org3b80b37">The most important thing: <i>Computer simulations are not empirical evidence</i></a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b80b37">
<p>
Computational techniques take a system of equations describing a
physical model (for example the equations we have derived), which
already rely on a whole variety of physical approximations (e.g.,
spherical symmetry, LTE, free-streaming neutrinos, etc.), and apply a
whole new set of <i>numerical</i> approximations to obtain a numerical
solution.
</p>

<p>
Presumably, nature does not do <i>any</i> of this: without opening the
philosophical question of whether nature writes down equations to
solve, it certainly does not need to make physical approximations
(while we need to do it to reason on a problem and keep it
manageable), and even less make <i>numerical</i> approximations needed to
solve equations. At ontological level, numerical simulations are <i>not</i>
equivalent to empirical evidence! Never trust numerical results as if
they were ground truth: a computer will only do what it is told, and
we tell it our physically and numerically approximated best guess for
what we are trying to simulate which is <i>not</i> what nature empirically
provides. I emphasize this as a person who spends most of his time
making numerical simulations! Note also how this is more general than
<i>just</i> stellar physics: this applies to <i>any</i> computational physics field.
</p>

<p>
Because of these, it is always crucially important to <i>do resolution
tests</i>: when performing a simulation of a physical phenomenon, you
should always test that the scientific results you obtain do not
depend on how you discretize your equations in time and space and on how
you numerically solve them. This is often a painful task, but very
important to not fool ourselves!
</p>

<p>
"<i>All models are wrong, but some are useful!</i>" - G. Box
</p>

<p>
In stellar physics, there is another problem: the <i>high non-linearity</i>
of the coupled system of ODEs means that there can be chaotic
behavior! A small perturbation (maybe because of a numerical error or
a small inconsistency in the tabulated input physics!) can cascade
into dramatic consequences, similar to the famous "butterfly effect"
(which was also theorized from numerical computations, but of
atmospheric physics, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz">E. Lorenz</a>).

<div id="outline-container-org426449d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org426449d"><a href="#org426449d">Why did we limit ourselves to spherical symmetry?</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org426449d">
<p>
Throughout the course so far we have explicitly assumed spherical
symmetry, although since the beginning we have discussed some
phenomena that can break the global spherical symmetry (e.g.,
rotation, magnetic fields, or the presence of gravity and/or
irradiation from companion stars), and we have seen phenomena (e.g.,
convection) that break the spherical symmetry locally. Without the
assumption of spherical symmetry, the equations describing our system
would become partial differential equations (PDE), changing the
mathematical and thus computational approach.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, it is possible to treat some of the non-spherical
effects by casting them in a form that still allows a 1D formalism
with ODEs (e.g., "shellular rotation" assuming that all quantities are
constant along isobars and uses P as the independent coordinate, e.g.,
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26A...361..159M/abstract">Maeder &amp; Meynet 2000</a>, or using volume-weighted equivalent potentials
accounting for the gravity of a companion star, e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJS..220...15P/abstract">Paxton et al.
2015</a>). But ultimately the physics is non-spherical, so why do we
insist with this limited approximation?
</p>

<p>
The main reason is <i>necessity</i> (see for example <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..262...19J/abstract">Jermyn et al. 2022

Consider the convective envelope in the Sun. It has a Reynolds number

from L to &ell; with a contrast L/&ell; &sim; Re<sup>3/4</sup> &sim; 10<sup>9</sup>. To resolve this

<p>
Assuming that Moore's law (the number of transistors in a CPU roughly
doubles every year) - an assumptions that may clash with the
engineering reality, it will take several decades to have a
numerically resolved 3D simulation of convection in a star for a
convective turnover timescale, and longer for thermal and nuclear
timescale: 1D will remain necessary, and we need to keep representing
the complex multi-scale, multi-physics, and multi-dimensional problem
of stellar evolution considering only variations along the radial

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf5041c1">
<p>
So, for the foreseeable future we will need 1D stellar structure and
evolution calculation using the set of equations we derived. To solve
them, we need boundary conditions. These are crucial in determining
the solution of the structure at each timestep!
</p>

<p>
For the stellar problem, we need to specify boundary conditions at two
locations.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgaa147f2" class="outline-4">

These are fairly intuitive:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>r(m=0) = 0. This is necessary to keep the local density &rho; &sim; m/r<sup>3</sup> finite.</li>
<li>L(m=0) = 0. This is necessary to keep the energy generation per
unit volume finite (as the volume goes to zero)</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, we have 4 ODEs and these are only two boundary conditions, so
the system is still undetermined. The central pressure and density are
not a priori known (we can estimate them, but that is not precise
enough!).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge837a68" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge837a68"><a href="#orge837a68">Surface</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge837a68">
<p>
We need to turn to the surface to get observationally informed
boundary conditions. Remember that from the point of view of a
detailed stellar evolution code, which assumes LTE to solve for the
internal structure, the "surface" (meaning: the outer boundary) is
usually defined at the photosphere. This is by definition the
"idealized" surface where T=T<sub>eff</sub> which corresponds to the location
outside of which LTE is not a good assumption anymore, the radiation
field is <i>not</i> isotropic, and the problem becomes the calculation of a
stellar <i>atmosphere</i>.
</p>

<p>
Accepting to externalize the problem of stellar atmosphere (which we
will treat in more detail <a href="./notes-lecture-radTrans.html">in a future lecture</a>), we already have
written one of the missing outer boundary conditions at mass
coordinate equal to the total mass of the star (m=M):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>T(m=M) = T<sub>eff</sub>, where T<sub>eff</sub> is <i>defined</i> as the temperature of a black
body producing the same luminosity as the star: L=4&pi; R<sup>2</sup>&sigma; T<sub>eff</sub>
with R=r(M).</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the final missing boundary condition, we need to specify the outer
pressure P(r=R) at R=r(M). This typically comes from imposing a <i>smooth</i>
transition from the stellar interior (inside, T &ge; T<sub>eff</sub>) and the
stellar atmosphere (outside, T &le; T<sub>edd</sub>), which requires calculating the
pressure in the stellar atmosphere where the assumptions we made so
far, and consequently the equations we wrote do not hold.

<h4 id="orga31b8e9"><a href="#orga31b8e9">Discretization</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga31b8e9">
<p>
First, to represent the system of equations in a computer we want to
discretize them, that is convert every derivative into a <i>finite
difference</i>. This can be done in various ways, each with specific
advantages and disadvantages. The simplest is a first-order forward
discretization of the form:
</p>

<div class="latex" id="org0e0482f">
\begin{equation}
\frac{df}{dx} \rightarrow \frac{f(x_{k+1})-f(x_{k})}{x_{k+1}-x_{k}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}

</div>
<p>
where f and x are a generic function and variable, and the index k
labels the discretized points.
</p>

<p>
For example, if x=m, the index k will label which cell of the
mass-coordinate "mesh" we are considering and m<sub>k+1</sub> - m<sub>k</sub> = &Delta; m<sub>k</sub> is the
local resolution in mass at location k, while if x=t, then k will
label the "timestep" we are considering, and t<sub>k+1</sub>-t<sub>k</sub> = &Delta; t<sub>k+1</sub> is the
timestep size.
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> typically both the spatial resolution &Delta; m<sub>k</sub> and the temporal
resolution &Delta; t<sub>k</sub> are <i>adaptive</i>, meaning the stellar evolution code will
put more mesh points where / take more timesteps when quantities vary
more rapidly. This is necessary to deal with the large dynamic range
of multiple quantities.
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> Nature &Gt; numerical models, because nature does not need to do
this!

By discretizing the ODEs we can rewrite them as algebraic equations:
</p>

<div class="latex" id="org513d9b2">
\begin{equation}

<p>
Now that we have transformed a set of ODEs into a set of algebraic
equations, the stellar structure and evolution problem is reduced to
solving a matrix equation:

</p>

<p>
To solve this we could consider two approaches:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Explicit methods</b>: in this case X(t<sub>k+1</sub>) is expressed as a function of
X(t<sub>k</sub>). This however will require resolving the <i>local</i> dynamics (and

<li><b>Implicit methods:</b> in this case we write a function F(X(t<sub>k</sub>), X(t<sub>k+1</sub>))
= 0 (e.g., F(X(t<sub>k</sub>), X(t<sub>k+1</sub>)) &equiv; AX(t<sub>k</sub>) - X(t<sub>k+1</sub>) = 0), and by solving the homogeneous
equation we have obtained we derive X(t<sub>k+1</sub>). Implicit methods are
preferred in stellar evolution as they are not limited by the sound
crossing time.</li>

For each of these methods, we still need to specify a numerical

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd3ede3b">
<p>
There is a peculiarity in the way we built the system of equations to
be solved: we have two boundary conditions at one edge of the (one dimensional) domain
(the center), and one set at the other edge (the surface).
</p>

<p>
Historically, the first computations of stellar models would use a
"shooting method": integrate numerically from the center outward, and
verify how far from the outer boundary conditions the solution lands,
based on the distance, calculate a correction on the initial guess,
and iterate. This was computationally expensive, and would require
many iterations before the solution build "inside out" would be
sufficiently good.
</p>

<p>
In the late 1960s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_G._Henyey">L. Henyey</a> designed an alternative solving strategy,
which was rapidly adopted by others and is still widely used today.
The key idea was to not start computing the variables inside out, but
instead, make an initial guess for the entire domain (typically the
initial guess can be the solution for the previous timestep!), and
calculate a correction not based on the distance between the solution
and the outer boundary condition only, but based on both boundaries at
the same time!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org058c32b">
<p>
One final peculiarity of the stellar structure and evolution problem
is that the evolution is <i>slow</i> and driven by nuclear physics, which
provides some of the hardest equations to solve, because they are
extremely <i>stiff</i>. Mathematically, this means the eigenvalues of the
nuclear physics part of the problem have very different norms, making
it challenging to design numerical algorithm that can find all the
eigenvalues efficiently. Physically, this is because many reactions
have extreme temperature sensitivities (because of the Coulomb
barriers and the tunneling probability).
</p>

<p>
The clear separation of timescales for the structure and evolution
(&tau;<sub>ff</sub> &Lt; &tau;<sub>KH </sub>&Lt; &tau;<sub>nuc</sub>) allows for one more trick, so called
"evolution splitting": one can compute the <i>structure</i> of the star
assuming fixed composition, then <i>evolve</i> the composition with that
fixed structure (meaning T, and &rho;), and iterate computing a new
structure with the updated composition. This allows to separate the
problem and can make it more tractable.

"<i>An algorithm must be seen to be believed</i>" - D. Knuth
</p>

<p>
The discussion above is an attempt to highlight the general principles
and technical aspects specific of computational stellar structure and
evolution without narrowing down to a specific code. Historically,
many groups independently developed computer codes to solve the
stellar structure and evolution problem, and only few universities
would have the computing power to run them. In the 1960s-1980s, even
if the group leaders may have been willing to share their codes upon
request, all the algorithmic details would typically be hidden from
the scientific community, and considered as technicalities. Many of
the people actually <i>writing</i> the code and <i>implementing the algorithms</i>
were women, and their contribution has been under-appreciated because
of this attitude of considering algorithms as technicalities.
</p>

<p>
Still today, the algorithmic details of many codes are only known to
the inner circle of the group owning the code. In 2011, an
independently wealthy computer-scientist-turned-astrophysicist free
from the publish-or-perish academic mentality named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Paxton_(computer_scientist)">Bill Paxton</a>, with
the collaboration of a large group of theoretical and computational
astrophysicists (notably, P. Eggleton who provided his code as a
starting point), developed a new open-source, multi-purpose, and
community driven stellar structure and evolution code, called <code>MESA</code>.
Because this is the tool I use, and the only one I can really inspect,
a lot of my intuition on the numerical methods and computational
aspects is tied to this particular code. The <code>MESA-web</code> interface you
have been using is just a predefined setup of this very flexible and
modular code designed for educational applications: you have been
using a bleeding edge research tools!
</p>

<p>
The release of this code, together with a change in perspective from
funding agencies and a general push towards open-science and
open-know-how (which necessarily require to get a handle on the
algorithmic details), has significantly changed the field of
theoretical and computational stellar evolution. Other codes ("the
GENEVA code" - a.k.a. GENEC, "the Frascati code" - a.k.a. FRANEC, "the
Cambridge code", KEPLER, HOSHI, etc.) are progressively opening up,
and at the very least being forced to compare their results with MESA.
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> the fact that most codes don't even have a name and are
identified with the institution where they are mainly developed is an
indication of the secrecy behind the computational aspects: you had to
be at the right place to get a handle on all the details!
</p>

<p>
This openness allows finally to check <i>systematic modeling errors</i> that
arise from algorithmic and numerical choices that may differ even for
the same physical assumptions and input physics. This has enabled
progress, revealed (always existing) bugs in MESA and in other codes,
and overall improved the state of this field.
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> Multiple independent codes are needed to cross-check and
validate results. The exponential growth of the community of users of
the MESA code has almost become a problem by quenching the use of
other codes in this problem space!

<h2 id="org579fbce"><a href="#org579fbce">Population synthesis</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org579fbce">
<p>
As we saw since the <a href="./notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.html">lecture on the CMD/HRD</a>, in stellar physics it is
often necessary to rely on <i>population studies</i> to infer something about
the physics of the star. Moreover, when thinking about galaxies (e.g.,
integrated light from a far away galaxy where not all stars are
resolved), we definitely need <i>populations</i>. Population studies are also
needed to predict <i>rates</i> of phenomena (e.g., supernovae, gravitational
wave mergers, etc.).
</p>

<p>
The practice of <i>combining</i> many stellar models to make a population is
generally referred to as <i>population synthesis</i>. This can be done with
<i>detailed</i> models, such as the one coming from codes that solve the
equations of stellar structure (e.g., MESA, KEPLER, FRANEC, PARSEC,
HOSHI, etc.).
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> These codes being 1D typically are <i>relatively</i> cheap to run,
about ~1-10&times; CPUh per model.
</p>

<p>
However, often there are many things one may want to change for <i>fixed</i>
stellar evolution (e.g., the initial distribution of stars, or their
metallicity distribution, or how they interact in binaries or higher
multiplicity systems), and recomputing all the models is not
necessary.
</p>

<p>
Since the 1990s, there has been the development of "semi-analytic"
techniques based on implementing polynomial fits to a set of stellar
models (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998MNRAS.298..525P/abstract">Pols et al. 1998</a>), and use these to simulate the
evolution of stars - producing a <i>rapid</i> population synthesis. Coupling
these to analytic models for the interaction of binaries (which are
used by detailed stellar codes too!), one can get <i>rapid</i> population
synthesis.
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> In these codes the stellar structure problem is "pre-solved" and
the use of semi-analytic fitting formulae to those solutions saves a
lot of time, going from 10s of CPUh per star/binary to &sim;100
CPU-millisecond per star/binary.
</p>

<p>
More recently, there has been a move to use directly tabulated results
from detailed stellar evolution codes, instead of analytic fits to
those tables, which allows to track more details (and more easily
update the stellar models) for a small computational price that is now
affordable.
</p>

<p>
Below is an (incomplete, biased) list of some of these codes.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcfa478c">
<p>
In two weeks from now we are going to do a class activity to piece
together all the things we have learned so far and describe the
evolution of single, non-rotating stars with <i>your</i> <code>MESA-web</code>-produced
models! Although we will stay close to the textbook stellar
evolution, this activity is similar to actually doing research with
stellar models: you compute a model, and see if it makes physical
sense based on physical intuition and contextual knowledge &#x2013; keeping
in mind that models can and do produce numerical nonsense
occasionally, and one has to be careful to not fool oneself!
Typically in research I will ran further models changing the input to
test my interpretation, run numerical tests (change the spatial and
temporal resolution for example), and iterate.
</p>

<p>
This preparation homework is not graded, I just ask you to gather
these models that we will discuss in class. Each student will have
one (randomly assigned) mass to run with MESA web, you will need to
download and unzip on your laptop and have it ready by
<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">2024-10-22 Tue</span></span>.
</p>

<p>
In class, you will gather in groups based on the masses you have run,
and be discuss among yourselves why the evolution proceeds the way it
does, whether you think it is physical or numerical artifacts, and we
will then discuss some of these models with the whole class.
</p>

<p>
We will mostly used the "movies" that <code>MESA-web</code> produces for you, but
feel free to prepare to read profile files and/or history files in a
script and plot other things to better understand what goes on.
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> The <code>MESA-web</code> interface can get clogged if you all ask
calculations the night before, so please to this well ahead - it's
just filling an online form!
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> for the sake of having a uniform set of models to discuss,
please use the options listed below for your <code>MESA-web</code> submission (I
listed all options but the mass and highlighted in <b>bold</b> the ones to
change w.r.t. the defaults).
</p>

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> if the models below do not reach the desired stopping
condition, feel free to try again with different parameters
(especially "Variance Control Target" and "Mesh Delta Coefficient"
which control the temporal and spatial resolution, lower means higher
resolution for both). Please keep the first model around too for the
in class activity.

<p>
The value specified the speed of collapse that the iron core needs
to reach before the model stops. Usually by this point of the
evolution &rho; is so high that &nu; interactions start to matter, the EOS
is not that of an ideal quantum gas + radiation, and the time left
before a NS is formed is of order of &sim;100 milliseconds (see also
<a href="./notes-lecture-SNe.html">lecture on supernovae</a>).
