Dear Professor,
Thank you for your kind words, it really helps, especially during this time of the semester. I have found the structure and organization of this class one of the best I have taken in undergrad. I also like the concept of student teaching and referring; definitely never been done before. Thank you for your teaching and I look forward to enjoying more topics in stellar astrophysics.

Sincerely
Swapnaneel Dey
