* Pre-main sequence and Hayashi track
We have developed a set of 4 non-linear, coupled ODEs to describe the
/structure/ and /evolution/ of stars (with physical approximations
built-in), with an EOS for closure conditions plus a set of equations
that describe the changes in composition due to nuclear processing and
mixing (see for example [[./notes-lecture-neutrinos.org::*Summary of equations we have derived][this summary]]).

We have also worked out the ordering of timescales of the problem:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\tau_\mathrm{nuc} \gg \tau_\mathrm{KH} \gg \tau_\mathrm{free\ fall} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which implies that for a star in hydrostatic equilibrium and LTE at
every location throughout the star (i.e., global gravothermal
equilibrium), the equations describing the (slow) /evolution/ of the
composition decouple from the 4 ODEs+EOS that describe the /structure/ of
the star.

The =MESA-web= stellar models at start at the /top right/ of the
Herzsprung-Russell diagram (so high $L$ low $T_\mathrm{eff}$) as a
uniform sphere of gas with set composition that is in hydrostatic but
not /necessarily/ thermal equilibrium /yet/.

*N.B.:* there may also be short initial numerical transients lasting a
few timesteps and irrelevantly short simulated physical time.

*N.B.:* the expression /top right/ above is relative, in its future
evolution the mode may evolve at even higher $L$ later on (but not lower
$T_\mathrm{eff}$!)

These models thus evolve on a thermal timescale $\sim\tau_\mathrm{KH}$
losing energy ($L$ goes down) and contracting -- picture lines of
constant $R=(L/(4\pi\sigma T_\mathrm{eff}^{4)}))^{1/2}$! This /is/ the gravothermal
Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction which leads to the increase in average $\langle
T \rangle$ by the virial theorem, and it goes on until either:
1. *degeneracy pressure stops this process by changing the EOS, tapping
   into quantum mechanical effects to provide extra pressure*: this
   should not happen to any of your models, but it is how you form a
   *Brown Dwarfs* (BD) and a planets. The distinction between these is
   whether some minor nuclear burning, energetically unimportant but
   still affecting the composition happens before the object sets on
   gravothermal equilibrium: BD experience deuterium burning, but
   deuterium is a loosely bound nucleus and its burning doesn't release
   a lot of energy.
2. *an energy source (namely nuclear burning) stops the collapse*. This
   is what happens to your stars, where H burning (as the lightest and
   most energy-releasing fuel) starts. The point where
   $L=L_\mathrm{nuc}$ because of H core burning is referred to as *Zero
   Age Main Sequence* (ZAMS), since the "main sequence" of the color
   magnitude diagram containing most stars is made of stars during
   their longest phase of evolution, hydrogen core burning.

*N.B.:* An isochrone at $t=0$ containing the stellar structures at
various masses when they reach the equilibrium condition
$L=L_\mathrm{nuc}$ is also referred to as ZAMS isochrone. For an
example, see the hottest, leftmost dashed isochrone on the HR diagram
from [[https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201833433][Schneider et al. 2018]] used [[file:notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.org::*Example: 30 Doradus region][here]].

From the ignition of H in the core onwards, for timescales $t \ll
\tau_\mathrm{nuc}$, once the composition is decided (i.e., for fixed mass
fractions ${X_{i}}$) the structure is determined by those 4 ODEs+EOS.
This means that the /initial/ structure of the star is /not/ sensitive to
the (complex, not-yet-fully understood) star formation process, and
the ZAMS structure is fully determined by the composition! This is
why, although the star formation process does not proceed starting
with a ball of known composition $\{X_{i}\}$ and fixed total mass $M$, we
can make stellar models starting from this idealized conditions, and
let them relax to a thermal equilibrium status solving the structure
equations.


** Pre-main sequence stellar structure

If the gravothermal collapse of the mass of gas considered ends with
the ignition of nuclear fuel (option 2. above), that is, if we make a
star (recall $\langle T \rangle \propto \mu M/R$, so the mass determines whether we get
here), then the phase from the beginning of the simulation until ZAMS
is called /pre-main-sequence/ (pre-MS).

During this phase the models start from the top-right of the diagram
at high $L$, large $R$ (\Rightarrow low $\langle T \rangle$), and progressively contract and heat
up. This is an idealization: often as stars are doing that, they still
accrete mass, in the most massive stars (which have shorter KH
timescales and pre-MS phases), accretion may not be over until even
after ZAMS! See for instance the recent review by [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ASPC..534..275O/abstract][Offner et al. 2023]].

*N.B.:* this accretion drives "outflows" in young stellar objects, which
can be "dusty" and thus opaque, making the pre-main sequence evolution
/embedded/ and hard to directly observe.

The $\langle T \rangle$ is initially low (the gas that is collapsing is coming
from the interstellar medium), and increasing. Since $\nabla = \partial \ln(T)/\partial
\ln(P) \propto \kappa L$ and $\kappa$ generally increases at low $T$, initially the
stars have steep temperature gradient and are /fully convective/! This
homogenizes their composition (but deuterium burning during the pre-MS
can change this), and also determines that $\nabla\simeq\nabla_\mathrm{ad}$ to very
good approximation.

Since almost arbitrarily high energy flux can be carried by
(efficient) convection maintaining an adiabatic gradient, this means
the luminosity of a fully convective star does not depend much on its
structure (unlike a stably stratified /radiative/ star where the
temperature gradient of the /structure/ is determined by the need of
carrying the flux out).

This leads to the evolution of these stars along an almost vertical
initial path on the HR diagram, the so-called /Hayashi track/ (see also
Sec. 9.1.1. of Onno Pols' lecture notes for an analytic approximation)
after [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chushiro_Hayashi][Chushiro Hayashi]]. The Hayashi track corresponds to solutions for
fully [[./notes-lecture-convection.org][convective]] stars. Wiggles around this vertical line are due to
recombination and partial ionization zones leading to deviations of
the temperature gradient $\nabla$ from adiabatic and burning of light
elements ($^{2}\mathrm{H}$, $^{7}\mathrm{Li}$) that releases some small
amount of energy.

*N.B.:* The energy release per nucleon of the burning of light elements
is very low and does not manage to alt the thermal-timescale
quasi-static collapse.

*The Hayashi line effectively determines a right, low-$T_\mathrm{eff}$
boundary on the HRD for stars in hydrostatic equilibrium*: if a star
were to be colder, it would have a steeper-than-adiabatic gradient
somewhere, which would imply a higher convective flux (cf. [[file:notes-lecture-convection.org::*Convective energy flux][convective
energy flux]])) and thus increase the luminosity of the star, moving the
star upwards back onto the Hayashi track.

*N.B.:* for these cool temperatures, we already know that the opacity is
dominated by $\mathrm{H}^{-}$, molecules, and dust, and we have
approximate powerlaw scalings with $T_\mathrm{eff}$ for analytic
considerations, but =MESA-web= uses tabulated values (cf. [[./notes-lecture-kappa.org][opacity
lecture]] and references therein).

The location in $T_\mathrm{eff}$ of the Hayashi track is dependent on
the mass $M$ of the star: more massive stars are hotter since the very
beginning. This can be analytically derived imposing $\nabla=\nabla_\mathrm{ad}$
and solving the remaining 3 ODEs assuming some form for $\kappa\equiv\kappa(T,\rho)$ at
the photosphere: effectively the outer boundary condition and
atmospheric physics determines this.

Stars to the left, hotter side of the Hayashi track instead must /not
be /fully convective/ and have some radiative layers (recombination and
light-elements burning changing $\kappa$ and $\mu$)!

* Main sequence

As the gravothermal collapse continues and $\langle T \rangle$ increases, at some
point, if we are making a star, by /definition/ nuclear burning turns on
(option 2. above). This is when the central temperature (which at this
stage is the highest temperature in the star), is sufficiently high to
obtain enough tunneling through the Coulomb barriers.

Because it is abundant, and its burning releases a lot of energy per
nucleon (\sim 6.5MeV/nucleon) because it produces the double-magic
nucleus $^{4}\mathrm{He} \equiv \alpha$ (neutrons /and/ protons fill their nuclear
"shells", by analogy with electron shells in atomic physics), hydrogen
is the first fuel to ignite, see also [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org][nuclear burning lecture]].

** Structure during the main sequence
As we discussed in the [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-cycles.org][nuclear reaction cycles lecture]], hydrogen
burning can occur in two different ways: pp-cycle and CN-NO bi-cycle.

Looking at =MESA-web= models, we can see that the pp-cycle is sufficient
to achieve the equilibrium condition $L_\mathrm{nuc}=\int dm
\varepsilon_\mathrm{nuc} \equiv L$ in low mass stars (*N.B.:* $L\propto M^{x}$ with $x\geq1$). This
is because the pp-cycle has lower Coulomb barriers (shallower relation
between $\varepsilon_\mathrm{nuc}$ and $T$) but a higher normalization (cf. [[file:notes-lecture-nuclear-cycles.org::*pp \rightarrow CNO transition][pp
\rightarrow CNO transition]]).

- *Very low M main sequence \Rightarrow fully convective*

For the lowest-mass stars, $T_\mathrm{eff}$ remains cold and the
opacity remains high: they burn through the pp cycle, but remain
/convective/ throughout the main sequence. In this case, /all/ of the
stellar material is available to burn, there is no core/envelope
structure at all! These stars however have (relatively speaking) very
low $L$, thus they evolve very slowly. All these stars in the Universe
are still on the main-sequence! This is the case of the $0.3M_{\odot}$
star you computed for a homework, which has an approximately
polytropic EOS because it is fully convective, thus has
$\nabla=\nabla_\mathrm{ad} \Rightarrow P\propto\rho^{\Gamma_{1}}$.

- *Low M main sequence \Rightarrow radiative core, convective envelope*

Moving slightly higher in mass, meaning also to higher $T_\mathrm{eff}$, a
radiative core appears. the burning is very concentrated in the
innermost region, but they are cool enough to have high \kappa at the
surface, and thus retain a convective /envelope/:

*N.B.:* we are seeing that the cooler $T_\mathrm{eff}$ is the deeper the
convective envelope! Increasing $T_\mathrm{eff}$ the convective layer
disappear in the deepest layers. This can be shown analytically (see
Onno Pols' lecture notes sec. 7.2.3).

- *High M main sequence \Rightarrow convective core, radiative envelope*

Increasing $M \Leftrightarrow T_\mathrm{eff}$ further, the equilibrium condition
$L=L_\mathrm{nuc}$ cannot be satisfied anymore with the pp-chain, and
the CN-NO bi-cycle kicks in. Because of its higher Coulomb barriers,
it has a steeper temperature dependence: the energy release is even
more concentrated, implying that $\nabla$ in the core is very steep (recall
$\nabla\propto \kappa L \propto \kappa L_\mathrm{nuc}$), thus /the core becomes convective/. This
means that convective mixing makes a larger mass of hydrogen available
to the very central burning zone. At the same time, higher $M$ \Rightarrow
higher $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and the envelope becomes radiative.

#+CAPTION: The "initial" gravothermal equilibrium structure of a star is determined only by mass $M$ and composition. The figure (Fig. 9.8 in Onno Pols' notes, modified from Kippenhahn & Weigert) shows in gray the region in mass coordinate $y=m/M$ that are convective as a function of the total mass $M=\int dm$ for $Z=0.02$ models. Red lines indicate where 50 and 90 % of the luminosity $L$ is generated (the "burning region") and the blue dashed lines show $r(m)=0.25M$ and $r(m)=0.5M$.

somewhat uncertain and dependent on input physics and modeling
assumptions.

:Question:
- *Q*: for your =MESA-web= models, what is the highest mass with a
  radiative main sequence core, and the lowest with convective main
  sequence core?
:end:

** Evolution during the main sequence
During the main sequence $L$ steadily increases on $\tau\sim\tau_\mathrm{nuc}$.
This is because the conversion of hydrogen into helium decreases $X$
(and increases $Y$), which enter in two key quantities, mean molecular
weight and electron scattering opacity:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:microphysics_XY}
\mu \simeq \frac{1}{2X+\frac{3}{4}Y+\frac{Z}{2}} \ \ , \\
\kappa_\mathrm{es} = 0.2(1+X) \ \ \mathrm{cm^{2}\ g^{-1}} \ \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
Assuming a star to be in gravothermal equilibrium and assuming
radiative energy transport (which we have just seen is not verified
everywhere by =MESA-web= models!), we know that:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:L_scaling}
L\propto \frac{\mu^{4} M^{3}}{\kappa} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
This scaling relation is approximate and does not exactly hold if a
star is not fully radiative (which we have already seen is not
accurate!), but it tells that:
- the higher $\kappa$, that is, the harder it is for photons to get out, the
  lower the luminosity
- the higher the mass, the higher the luminosity (\Rightarrow the higher the
  nuclear burning rate for a given fuel!), and since the mass exponent
  is larger than 1, this implies that /more massive stars have shorter
  lifetimes w.r.t. lower mass stars/. They do have more fuel available
  ($\propto M$), but they burn through it at an even higher rate ($\propto M^{3}$)! In fact
  single-star lifetimes of stars that burn all the way to iron is only
  \sim10-50Myr ($M_\mathrm{ZAMS}\ge7.5M_{\odot}$, with the exact lower limit
  depending on $Z$, rotation, binary interactions, cf. for example
  [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PASA...34...56D/abstract][Doherty et al. 2017]] and [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850..197P/abstract][Poelarends et al. 2017]]), compared to \gt 10^{9}
  years for $M_\mathrm{ZAMS}\le2M_{\odot}$.

[[./images/stellar_lifetimes.png]]

- the higher the mean molecular weight $\mu$ (= number of particles per
  baryonic mass), the higher the luminosity.


Using Eq. \ref{eq:L_scaling} we can infer that the high power of \mu
drives the luminosity evolution of the stars during the main sequence:
because hydrogen is converted into helium ($X \rightarrow Y$), the *mass-weighted
average $\langle \mu \rangle = \int dm \mu(m)/\int dm$ increases and thus L increases*.

*N.B.:* massive and low mass stars however have a very different
morphology of the main sequence. For stars with radiative cores
(burning through the pp-chain, $M\le1.2M_{\odot}$), $L$ increases, $R$
varies little, thus since $L=4\pi R^{2}\sigma T_\mathrm{eff}^{4}$ in
equilibrium, we also see a slight increase in temperature of the star
during the main sequence. Conversely, massive stars with convective
cores (burning through the CNO cycle, $M\geq1.2M_{\odot}$) increase in
radius and actually become /cooler/ as they evolve during the main
sequence. One can derive (see Onno Pols' notes chapter 7) analytic
$R(M)$ relations assuming a specific scaling for the energy generation
to qualitatively explain this. In reality, the details of the core
evolution (influenced by uncertain processes such as convective
boundary mixing) and envelope (influenced by wind uncertainties)
matter for the details.

*N.B.:* The relative role of $\mu$ and $\kappa$ is slightly sensitive to
metallicity too (because at lower $Z$ the approximation
$\kappa\simeq\kappa-\mathrm{es}$ is progressively better since fewer bound-bound and
bound-free transitions are available, see also [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.5816X/abstract][Xin et al. 2022]]). The
opacity $\kappa$ is dominant in determining the $L$ and $R$ at ZAMS for
$Z\simeq0.02$, but the change in $\mu$ is determining their /evolution/ along
the main sequence.

:Question:
- *Q*: based on the scaling in Eq. \ref{eq:L_scaling}, how does the
  luminosity of two identical stars differing only in $Z$ compare?
  Which star has the highest $L$? (*Hint*: you can compute more =MESA-web=
  models of your mass varying $Z$ to check your answer!)
:end:

Looking at the Kippenhahn diagrams and composition diagrams from
=MESA-web= we can also see what the model does in the core (something
not /directly/ accessible to observations - if not through neutrinos).
For low mass stars with radiative cores and high $\rho_\mathrm{center}$
(something you can derive from the virial theorem + hydrostatic
equilibrium + EOS), partial degeneracy already plays a role in
sustaining the structure during the main sequence, and as the central
burning region converts hydrogen into helium, the helium core becomes
hot and degenerate - thus sustaining itself against gravitational
collapse with the quantum effects due to the Fermi-Dirac statistics of
electrons.

Conversely, high mass stars have a convective core: convective mixing
connects the innermost burning region with a larger fuel reservoir.
The progressive burning of hydrogen changes the center opacity (well
approximated by electron scattering only in the hot, fully ionized
interior) $\kappa\simeq\kappa_\mathrm{es}=0.2(1+X)$ cm^{2} g^{-1}. Specifically, as $X$
decreases, so does $\kappa$, and since $\nabla = \partial ln(T)/\partial ln(\rho) \propto \kappa L$, the
temperature gradient becomes "less steep", meaning there is less need
for convection: /during the main sequence of massive stars, the
convective core receeds in mass coordinate/.

* End of the main sequence

*** "Low" mass stars with radiative cores

Very low mass stars smoothly evolve off the main sequence: if you look
at the $T(\rho)$ diagram in the movie produced by =MESA-web=, from the
outlines of the track you can see where the nuclear burning moves.

#+CAPTION: Screenshot of a =MESA-web= calculation of a $1M_{\odot}$ star shortly after the main sequence. The HRD (bottom left) shows a smooth end of the main sequence, and the Kippenhahn diagram and $T(\rho)$ tracks (middle) show that all the burning is in a shell surrounding the inert He core. The bottom right panel shows that the inner region as a flattening $T$ profile because of conduction efficiently transporting energy and erasing the $dT/dr$.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/1Msun_TAMS.png]]

Since these are stars that were burning radiatively (the fully
convective ones have not yet finished their main sequence even if they
had been burning since the birth of the Universe!), they have fresh
fuel available that has not been mixed in the burning region just
outside the region hot enough for hydrogen burning. Therefore,
*hydrogen ignites in a shell* around the now H-depleted, He-rich core.

Because of the gap in $T$ to bridge the Coulomb barriers for
hydrogen-burning and $3\alpha$, Helium core burning does /not/ ignite
immediately: the Helium core sits inert, contracts, degeneracy
pressure starts to matter and conduction becomes important, leading to
an almost /isothermal/ He core sitting below the H shell.

The morphology of the end of the main sequence for low mass stars with
radiative cores is /smooth/: the core contracts, the shell above it
contracts and it is immediately hot enough to burn. The temperature of
the shell is determined by the /contraction/ of the inert He core,
rather than by the energy generation by nuclear physics. Therefore,
the shell is typically becoming hot enough to burn through the CNO
cycle even for a low mass star.

*** "High" mass stars with convective cores

Increasing the mass above the threshold for activating the CN-NO
bi-cycle (somewhere $\sim1.1-1.3M_{\odot}$ depending on assumptions), the
morphology of the end of the main sequence changes.

#+CAPTION: Screenshot of a =MESA-web= calculation of a $30M_{\odot}$ star shortly after the main sequence. The HRD (bottom left) shows the "Henyey hook" feature, the Kippenhahn diagram and $T(\rho)$ track shows that there is an off-center H-burning shell but the He in the core ignites promptly too. The core is not degenerate, but convective again, and maintains a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/30Msun_TAMS.png]]

In this case, during the main sequence the /burning/ is even more
centralized in mass and radius coordinate than for lower-mass
pp-chain-sustained stars, but that drives /convection/. Therefore,
convective mixing refuels the burning region from a larger reservoir,
and when the fuel runs out, it means that there is a gap in the star
between where $T$ is hot enough for nuclear reactions and where viable
fuel is. This causes an "overall contraction phase", also known as
"Henyey hook", where the star, out of energy sources resumes its
gravothermal collapse and shrinks in radius.

This process increases the temperature profile until the H-rich fuel
left at the edge of the convective core ignites in a shell. However,
the He core below, whose mass is set by the extent of convection
(+convective boundary mixing) during the main sequence, is too big to
be sustained by electron degeneracy pressure and too hot to be
degenerate (recall that $\langle T \rangle \propto \mu M/R$): below the shell the
contraction continues until He also promptly ignites through the 3\alpha
reaction, driving core convection!

* H-shell and He burning

"[The post main sequence acts as a] /sort of magnifying glass, also
revealing relentlessly the faults of calculations of earlier phases/" -
Kippenhahn.

** Low mass star "flashes"

For low mass stars the He core is sufficiently small to be
electron-degeneracy supported, and there is H-rich fuel available
right outside the region that was burning during the main sequence:
after exhausting H in their core, they smoothly transition to a
H-shell burning/He core degenerate phase. During this phase the core
contracts and the envelope expands dramatically: the star appears as a
red giant (RG)!

*N.B.:* during this phase the He core is degenerate and /conduction/ by
electrons efficiently transports energy making the whole core
approximately isothermal. This leads to the Schonberg-Chandrasekhar
maximum mass that it can have.

The microphysical reason for this expansion is not perfectly
understood (and roughly once per decade a new tentative partial
explanation is put forward). Nevertheless, we are confident that this
does occur as we can see it happening across stellar populations. One
partial explanation often invoked is the so called "mirror principle":
when there is a shell source of energy, as the inner region contracts
the outer regions expand (and viceversa). This "mirror principle" can
be understood in terms of the virial theorem in its most complete form
(including the $\ddot{I}$ term dependent on the moment of inertia):
since the core contracts (decreasing the moment of inertia), the
envelope needs to expand to compensate (increasing the moment of
inertia). Another way to justify this semi-empirical "mirror
principle" is to keep the shell energy generation constant (see Onno
Pols' lecture notes, chapter 10).

The H-shell ignites wherever there is available fuel, its lower
boundary temperature thus is determined by the structure of the
contracting core, which typically exceeds the T threshold for the CNO
cycle: even stars that burn through the pp-chain on the main sequence
will do the CNO cycle later! The shell energy release also determines
the structure of the envelope above: once the star is /not homogeneous/
anymore, the simple gravothermal collapse due to the virial theorem
complicates!

This also implies that it is the core structure which determines the
properties of the shell, which determines the envelope properties
(namely the luminosity): in fact we observe tight correlations between
the core mass and the luminosity of the star.

As the evolution proceeds, the shell "climbs up in mass coordinate"
(though its radius may stay constant or decrease even as the
underlying inert He core contracts). The $T_\mathrm{eff}$ decreases
and the convective envelope deepens ($T_\mathrm{eff}$ drops,
$T_\mathrm{shell}$ is set by the core contraction and locked by
nuclear reactions, thus $\nabla$ steepens), this can reach the inner most
layers (partially enriched in He, especially $^{3}\mathrm{He}$, and
possibly $^{14}\mathrm{N}$ if the star experienced some CN cycle),
leading to the "first dredge up": material from the inner layers above
the H-shell is mixed outwards by convection and becomes visible in the
stellar atmosphere.

As the shell moves upwards by consuming H fuel (and dumping He ashes
onto the core), it will encounter a layer mixed by convection in the
first dredge up. The outward mixing of nuclearly processed material
also corresponds to inward mixing of H-rich envelope material: the
shell thus reaches a region that is /more fuel rich/ than before! This
makes the shell briefly exceed the $L_\mathrm{nuc} = L$ condition, the
overproduction of energy pushes the envelope to higher $L$, lower
$T_\mathrm{eff}$, and lowers the \rho in the shell, causing a decrease of
$L_\mathrm{nuc}$. This process ultimately results in stars crossing a
certain luminosity threshold 3 times: observationally this produces a
cumulation of stars at a certain luminosity or in other words a "bump"
in the luminosity distribution.

*N.B.:* for massive stars, discussed below, the "first dredge up" may
not occur as described here, but the H-shell will also move outwards
towards more H-rich fuel causing a $3\times$ crossing of a certain
luminosity.

*** He flash

Above is a =pgstar= movie of the He flash(es) in a $1M_{\odot}$ star computed
with =MESA= by [[https://www.stellarphysics.org/][M. Cantiello]]. Note the panels are /different/ than in the
=MESA-web= configuration, and the HRD does /not/ show the pre-main
sequence.

As the H burning shell adds nuclear ashes to the underlying inert He
core, until it reaches a mass that cannot be sustained by degeneracy
pressure anymore, and He ignites. This typically occurs for
$M_\mathrm{He}\simeq0.45M_{\odot}$.

This ignition however happens in a degenerate environment where $P$
does /not/ depend on $T$! Therefore the energy released by the burning
of He initially does not increase $dP/dr$ and does not cause an
expansion of the core, instead it all remains as internal energy,
raising the temperature and increasing the nuclear burning rate: this
situation (which presents itself any time there is a nuclear ignition
in a degenerate environment) is clearly unstable and leads to the so
called "Helium flash". Burning rises $T$ until $P$ transitions from
being mostly due to electron degeneracy to being ideal gas again: this
causes an abrupt change in pressure and a temporarily /dynamical/ phase
of the evolution!

Because this requires a specific He core mass, and the He core mass
before the flashes is determining the total luminosity of the red
giant, this means that pre-flash there is a "standardizable" maximum
luminosity of red giants, the so called "tip of the red giant branch",
which is nowadays used as an alternative method to measure distances
for cosmological applications.

The occurrence of neutrino cooling in the core can cause the burning
during the He flash to be initially off-center. Moreover, the star can
react to the flash by (finally) expanding the core and decreasing the
burning rate, and on a span of a few thermal timescale, minor
secondary flash can occur as the core re-collapses, until He core
burning finally stabilizes, lifting degeneracy and causing core
convection.

*** Red clump and Horizontal branch

During He core burning, low mass stars have a convective core burning
thought the $3\alpha$ (and later $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$),
surrounded by an inert He layer, and a H-burning shell wherever H
becomes available. Above the H-burning shell, if there is a
substantial H-rich envelope, it will be convective: these stars are
close to the Hayashi track (by radius they are mostly convective), but
on the hotter side (because of the existing radiative layers).

Since the He flash occurs as soon as the He core mass reaches a
sufficient mass, all these stars have similar luminosities, and form
the so-called "red clump" on the HR diagram, a noticeable feature in
cluster and galaxy populations that can also be used for distance and
age estimates (see also for example [[https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-astro-081915-023354][Girardi 2016]]). Since the mass of
the He core at ignition for low mass stars is set by the He flash at
$\sim0.45M_{\odot}$, the lower mass stars will have less envelope at this
point (more has been processed into He to reach the threshold mass for
the flash): from the red clump a there is a continuous almost
horizontal line (they all have roughly the same luminosity set by the
core mass) of stars in the HR diagram for low mass core-He burning
stars whose coolest end is the red clump.

** High mass stars and "Hertzsprung gap"

Stars with masses sufficiently high for the core to be convective
during the hydrogen core burning main sequence ($M\geq1.2M_{\odot{}}$
roughly, depending on assumptions) will /not/ have a phase of evolution
with an inert, isothermal He core: the core is too big for degeneracy
pressure to sustain it and after the main sequence it continues
contracting until the 3\alpha reaction activates and He burns. The prompt
post "Henyey hook" appearance of two nuclear energy sources (He core
and H shell) drives the star towards the cool side of the HR diagram
very quickly ($\sim \tau_\mathrm{KH}$), becoming red supergiants (RSG)

Thus, in the HRD of a coeval stellar population, there will be many
stars on the main sequence ($\tau\sim\tau_\mathrm{nuc,H}$) and close to the
Hayashi track as RSG ($\tau\sim\tau_\mathrm{nuc,He}$), but very few in between:
this is often referred to as the "Hertzsprung gap". *N.B.:* the scarcity
of stars in the gap is only due to the timescales of evolution, it is
not a forbidden region of the HRD.

Some stars may experience "blue loops" as their H-shell climbs upward
in mass coordinate and encounters layers with more H (see for example
[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.447.2951W/abstract][Walmswell et al. 2015]]). The occurrence of these is very sensitive to
numerical approximations and make solid predictions hard, but their
physical nature in some cases is supported by observations. Depending
on metallicity, some stars may even spend most of their He core
burning time in a blue loop appearing hotter than a typical RSG.

*** Mass loss and single-star evolution path to Wolf-Rayet
As $M$ increases (and consequently even more so $L$), mass loss
becomes a progressively more important ingredient for the evolution of
stars.

Stars can lose mass through:
 - stellar winds (pressure driven for low mass stars, radiation driven
   for high mass stars)
 - eruptive events (e.g., "luminous blue variable eruptions")
 - binary interactions

All of these can directly or indirectly impact the internal structure
of the star, and its appearance. Very massive stars may have such high
mass loss rates that they lose their entire H-rich envelope already
during the main sequence (becoming WNh stars). Moving to lower masses,
they may evolve red-ward on the HR diagram (which increases the
opacity \kappa and thus presumably the wind mass-loss rate, although this
is highly debated presently, see [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ARA%26A..52..487S/abstract][Smith 2014]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...603A.118R/abstract][Renzo et al. 2017]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.5994B/abstract][Beasor
et al. 2020]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...681A..17D/abstract][Decin et al. 2024]]), and then shed their H-rich envelope.

A star which has lost its envelope will "reveal" its He core, and if
luminous enough, this will drive a thick wind that can enshroud the
star and hide it below a "pseudo-photosphere". These winds can be so
dense that collisional excitation produces emission lines, making the
stars appear as WR (see e.g., [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241004436S/abstract][Shenar 2024]]).

*N.B.:* stripped low and intermediate mass stars not luminous enough to
drive WR-like outflows that produce emission lines are predicted and
observed and require binary interactions to form, see [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023Sci...382.1287D/abstract][Drout et al.
2023]].

* Late evolution

** Low mass stars: AGB thermal pulses and WD cooling

After the end of He core burning, the /vast/ majority of stars ($\sim 98\%$
of all stars integrating over the birth-mass distribution for
$M_{ZAMS}\le 7.5M_{\odot}$) is left with a carbon/oxygen rich degenerate
core which is not massive enough to ignite further nuclear burning,
and electron degeneracy sustains it. Such core is surrounded by a
He-rich layer, and further out by a H-rich envelope. Thus, these stars
still need to lose their H-rich extended envelope and He-rich shell
(which remain temporarily sustained by nuclear burning in shells)
before they can finally rest as white dwarfs entirely sustained by
degeneracy pressure. This process is relatively fast and involves
copious (and possibly episodic) stellar outflows which are still an
active topic of research.

A star in this phase is referred to as an "Asymptotic Giant Branch"
(AGB) star: for most of its life the He layer is inert (no nuclear
burning) and (partially) degenerate too, and it grows in mass because
of the ashes of the overlaying H-burning shell, which sustains the
H-rich envelope above it.

As the He layer grows in mass, it temporarily ignites: this energy
release causes a /flash/ (similar to He ignition in the core for low
mass stars in the first place), and expands the He layer, pushing
outward the inner boundary of the H-shell, often until its temperature
becomes too low for H-burning. Thus, as a consequence of the He shell
flash, matter is pushed out and cools (possibly forming dust and
increasing \kappa and thus the mass loss from the star), the H shell shuts
off, but the He shell too does. This is because the flash was not
hydrostatic self-regulated burning! The outer layers then re-collapse
on a thermal timescale and as they contract, the H-burning shell
ignites first (it's easier to burn H than He!), returning to the
initial situation, but with a little less mass. This process of
"thermal AGB pulses" ultimately will lead to the loss of all the H and
He, leaving a "bare" CO core exposed, with only a very thin H/He
atmosphere.

*N.B.:* ignition in a (partially) degenerate environment causes an
abrupt increase in T and thus P from the ideal gas EOS, but the
environment was supported by a T-independent degeneracy pressure: this
leads to a discontinuity in time of the pressure and thus a /dynamical/
event, referred to as a Flash. This can also occur in the core of
massive stars!

The result of this process of "thermal pulses" in AGB is that the
H-rich envelope and He-rich shell are progressively ejected (though
the exact rate and mass loss mechanism are still an active topic of
research), leaving a hot carbon-oxygen WD in the center (the former
core) shining into a low-density nebula made by the ejecta. This is a
/planetary nebula/ (although it has little to do with anything related
to planets). A catalog of planetary nebulae images is available [[https://faculty.washington.edu/balick/PNIC/][here]],
and the figure below shows an example.

#+CAPTION: Example of an /HST/ image of a planetary nebula: NGC6543 (aka Cat's eye nebula). In the center is a young WD star, and the shape of the nebula depends on the mass ejection process and the propagation of these ejecta (e.g., interacting with a planetary system around the star).

After losing their envelopes to thermal pulses (possibly accompanied
by a late enhancement of their stellar winds), low mass stars rapidly
move from the top right (high $L$ low $T_\mathrm{eff}$) corner of the
HR diagram to the lower left (low $L$ high $T_\mathrm{eff}$) corner
becoming white dwarfs (WD): this process of contraction occurs on a
thermal timescale. In WDs the gravothermal collapse stops because of
the electron degeneracy pressure: the degeneracy decouples their
structure (which can be approximated assuming $k_{B}T\ll \varepsilon_\mathrm{Fermi}
\Rightarrow T\simeq 0$) and their radiative properties.

These sit in the bottom left corner of the HR diagram: they actually
have /hotter/ surface temperatures compared to a main sequence star!
This high T means they do radiate and lose energy, but because of the
small radius ($R\simeq0.01R_{\odot}\simeq 1000$ km) they have a low luminosity
$L=4\pi R^{2} \sigma T_\mathrm{eff}$: their radiative cooling is very slow
(timescale of billions of years). The WD will just "slide down slowly"
on a cooling track. The WD cooling sequence provides a /clock/ for
stellar populations!

*N.B.:* Because of the $M(R)$ relation for non-relativistic electron
degeneracy gas in hydrostatic equilibrium, the /lower mass WDs have
larger $R$/, thus for a given $T_\mathrm{eff}$, they also have /higher
$L$/ (see [[./notes-lecture-EOS2.org][lecture on degenerate EOS]] and related homework).

*** The /Gaia/ spur: observational evidence for crystallization

As the WD cools, its core density increases, and its degenerate plasma
will at some point crystallize. This phase transition releases latent
heat thus slows down the cooling: in isochrones of WD populations we
should expect an overabundance of stars in the region where we expect
crystallization to occur, and this was tentatively observed thanks to
the /Gaia/ DR2 dataset for WDs within 100pc from Earth ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Natur.565..202T/abstract][Tremblay et al.
2019]]):

#+CAPTION: HR diagram for a complete volume-limited sample of WDs within 100pc from /Gaia/ DR2. The color of points indicates spectroscopically determined masses based on [[https://www.sdss.org/][SDSS]], red dots mark magnetized WD (again from their spectra), and dotted orange lines enclose the predicted region where crystallization of the WD covers between 20% (top) and 80% of the total mass, and contains an overabundance of stars as predicted by the release of latent heat. This is Fig. 2 from [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Natur.565..202T/abstract][Tremblay et al. 2019]].

*N.B.:* Crystallization of a C-rich WD makes a stellar-mass, Earth-size
diamond!

Other physical phenomena that can influence the evolution of WDs is
the gravitational sedimentation of the composition, with heavier
elements sinking and lighter elements rising, and for sufficiently
high $L$ (young WDs) there can also be radiative levitation, where the
most opaque elements (typically the primordial iron present) will be
pushed upwards by radiation.

:Question:
 - *Q*: Based on the energy transport mechanism that can occur in stars,
   what do you expect the $T(m)$ or $T(r)$ structure of the WD core to
   be? (*hint*: think of what provides the pressure support of a WD)
 - *Q*: Consider the formation of Helium WDs. These are observed,
   however, to form from a single star not-massive-enough to ignite He
   burning, it would take longer than the current age of the Universe
   (because low $M$ \Rightarrow much lower $L \Rightarrow L_\mathrm{nuc} = L$ drives a
   very slow evolution). Therefore, apparently, the existence of He
   WDs is paradoxical! Can you think of any solution to this apparent
   paradox?
:end:


** High mass stars: \nu speedup the evolution

As we discussed in the [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org][nuclear burning]] and [[./notes-lecture-neutrinos.org][neutrino lectures]], for
initially sufficiently massive stars ($M\geq7-8M_{\odot}$) the electron
degeneracy pressure never suffice to stop the gravothermal collapse.
As gravity drives their cores to higher and higher densities, $L_{\nu}
\gg L_{\gamma}$ decoupling the neutrino-cooled core from the envelope: the
nuclear timescale of the core becomes shorter than the thermal
timescale of the envelope.

*N.B.:* partial electron degeneracy may play a role, depending on the
 mass, and at late burning phases "flashes" similar to the He flash in
 low mass stars can occur deep in the core.

Thus these stars proceed through burning all the way to iron, and
each new fuel ignites in a more centralized, hotter mass range,
surrounded by an inert layer, and then a shell of the previous nuclear
fuel above it, creating the "onion structure" we have already seen.

While in theory the envelope should be completely "frozen" at this
point, early observations of supernova explosions suggest that some
/dynamical/ coupling between core and envelope must occur in the last
final years and months of the star, a topic of great research interest
presently (see for example the review by [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240504259D/abstract][Dessart 2024]]).

*** super-AGB stars

Because of \nu cooling and its dependence on $\rho$, in AGB stars the
denser center cools faster than the layers above it: this can lead to
a "temperature inversion". At the boundary between white dwarf
progenitors and massive stars, the so-called "super-AGB" stars will
ignite C off-center, but the ignition of carbon will then move inwards
(in a \sim meter thin shell) until it reaches the center, lifting the
electron degeneracy by releasing nuclear energy, and allowing the star
to evolve past C core burning.

The lowest mass stars experiencing C core burning thus ignite it off
center and burn it into a mixture of oxygen, neon, magnesium, after
which they can experience thermal pulses (like lower mass AGB stars),
leaving behind ONeMg WD.

At the upper end of this regime, the most massive ONeMg cores
(possibly still surrounded by He- and H-rich layers) will then become
supported by degeneracy pressure again, but as they cool and
contracts, they can reache densities sufficient to start electron
captures, which remove the electrons sustaining the core leading to a
so-called "electron capture SN" (which effectively is a core-collapse
SN initiated by a degenerate ONeMg core rather than a Fe core).
