* 400A Theoretical Astrophysics - Stellar Evolution

Material developed for a one-semester course at the Department of
Astronomy and Steward Observatory of the University of Arizona.

A. Eddington, 1927: /Someday, we should be able to understand something
as simple as a star/

F. Hoyle and R. O. Redman: "/...Fundamentally, a star is a pretty
simple structure"/ "/You'd look simple too at a distance of ten
parsecs!/"
