* Gravity's victory over nuclear energy release

"Massive stars" can be defined as those that will end their life
forming a compact object, either a neutron star (NS) or a black hole
(BH). This requires them to consume (at least partially) the
oxygen-rich core, that is, for the widest range of initial masses, to
build a silicon-rich core and subsequently iron-rich core that is too
massive to be sustained by the electron degeneracy pressure (M_{Fe} \ge
M_{Chandrasekhar}). This core is therefore doomed to collapse under the
influence of its own self-gravity, and this can result in a successful
supernova explosion. For single massive stars, this happens for
initial mass M_{ZAMS} \ge 7-10M_{\odot}, depending on their metallicity and
rotation rate ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PASA...34...56D][Doherty et al. 2017]]). The presence of companions, which
is the rule rather than the exception ([[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Sci...337..444S][Sana et al. 2012]]), can also
change this threshold ([[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...601A..29Z][Zapartas et al. 2017]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850..197P/abstract][Poelarends et al. 2017]]).

*N.B.:* In other subfields, for example asteroseismology or exoplanets,
"massive" may just mean "with a convective main sequence core",
meaning M_{ZAMS} \ge 1.2-1.3M_{\odot}.

*N.B.:* At the lower mass end, super-AGB supernova progenitors may reach
the onset of core collapse because of electron-captures in the oxygen,
neon, magnesium degenerate core instead of because electron-captures
in the iron core (cf. [[file:in-class-evol-wrap-up.org::*super-AGB stars][sAGB evolution]]).

At the very end of the evolution, the degenerate iron core is too
massive to be sustained by the electron degeneracy pressure, and
therefore it collapses because of gravity, reaches (super--)nuclear
density (\rho\geq10^{14} g cm^{-3}), bounces due to the repulsive core of the
nuclear force and this triggers a shock-wave.

*N.B.:* The collapse and bounce is analogous to a ball bouncing off a
wall which momentarily compresses a bit and momentum changes sign in
the direction perpendicular to the wall progressively across the ball
volume. In this analogy, for a collapsing star, the wall is the inner
core reaching super-nuclear densities.


The shock wave launched is thought to explode the star, unbinding the
stellar envelope. However, historically (hydrodynamical) simulations
have had limited success in producing explosions. In most cases, the
shock just stops or reverts deep in the star. Therefore, a
``shock-revival'' mechanism (usually neutrino heating behind the shock
aided by asymmetries in the flow) is needed to push it further and
make it succeed in unbinding the stellar envelope.

The stellar structure (especially of the deepest layers) is paramount
for the success or failure of the SN explosion, especially the density
profile that the shock will encounter moving outward. But the details
of the stellar structure depend on the late burning stages (namely,
[[./notes-lecture-nuclear-cycles.org::*Silicon core burning][Silicon burning]]]) of the star, and on the mixing processes during these
phases.

Several attempts to define a (small set of) parameter(s) describing
the pre-collapse core structure that could predict the outcome of the
simulation of a SN explosion (success or failure, NS or BH remnant)
have been made (e.g.,[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...730...70O/abstract][O'connor & Ott 2011]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...818..124E/abstract][Ertl et al. 2016]], [[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190201340C][Couch et
al. 2019]]). Because the late burning phases and ultimately the
formation of the collapsing core itself is a multi-physics,
multi-scale, and likely stochastic problem, any attempt to define such
a parameter is necessarily an attempt to average and (over?) simplify
the structure ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.487.5304M/abstract][Mueller 2019]]).

The thermal state and composition of the iron core are of crucial
importance for the collapse itself: a slight variation in one of these
cause significant differences in the density profile of the star and
can in principle influence the outcome of the evolution (i.e.
successful explosion, or not). As an example, the amount of free
electrons in the core, which is quantified by $Y_e=1/\mu_{e}$:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
  Y_e=\ \sum_i \frac{Z_i}{A_i}X_i \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

enters quadratically in the effective Chandrasekhar
mass,

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Mcha}
  M_\mathrm{Fe} \geq M_\mathrm{Ch}^\mathrm{eff} \simeq (5.80 M_\odot) Y_e^2\left[1 +
    \left(\frac{s_e}{\pi Y_e}\right)^2\right]%1.44M_\odot(2 Y_e)^2 \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

that is the maximum mass that can be sustained by electron degeneracy
pressure, where s_{e} is the electrons specific entropy and the term
dependent on it is a "thermal correction" to account for the fact that
not the entire core is fully degenerate and with k_{B}T\ll\varepsilon_{Fermi}.

The dynamics of the collapse, and therefore the success or failure of
the explosion, depend on the structure (temperature, density, etc.)
and details of the composition of the core (see also [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...783...10S/abstract][Sukhbold &
Woosley 2014]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..227...22F/abstract][Farmer et al. 2016]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024RNAAS...8..152R/abstract][Renzo et al. 2024]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240902058L/abstract][Laplace et al.
2024]]).
