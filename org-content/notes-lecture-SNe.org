*Disclaimer:* Here, we discuss the collapse and possible explosion of
massive stars, that is "core collapse supernovae" (CCSNe). These are
/not/ the only kind of supernova transient that can be observed, and our
focus here excludes SNIa, pair-instability supernovae, luminous red
novae, tidal disruption events, etc. (see also [[./projects.org][projects]]).

* Gravity's victory over nuclear energy release

"Massive stars" can be defined as those that will end their life
forming a compact object, either a neutron star (NS) or a black hole
(BH). This requires them to consume (at least partially) the
oxygen-rich core, that is, for the widest range of initial masses, to
build a silicon-rich core and subsequently iron-rich core that is too
massive to be sustained by the electron degeneracy pressure (M_{Fe} \ge
M_{Chandrasekhar}). This core is therefore doomed to collapse under the
influence of its own self-gravity, and this can result in a successful
supernova explosion. For single massive stars, this happens for
initial mass M_{ZAMS} \ge 7-10M_{\odot}, depending on their metallicity and
rotation rate ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PASA...34...56D][Doherty et al. 2017]]). The presence of companions, which
is the rule rather than the exception ([[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Sci...337..444S][Sana et al. 2012]]), can also
change this threshold ([[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...601A..29Z][Zapartas et al. 2017]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850..197P/abstract][Poelarends et al. 2017]]).

*N.B.:* At the lower mass end, super-AGB supernova progenitors may reach
the onset of core collapse because of electron-captures in the oxygen,
neon, magnesium degenerate core producing a so-called "electron
capture SN" (cf. [[file:in-class-evol-wrap-up.org::*super-AGB stars][sAGB evolution]]) instead of because electron-captures
in the iron core. In reality, al CCSNe /are/ electron-capture SNe
because electron captures always play a role in accelerating the
collapse (see below).

*N.B.:* In other subfields, for example asteroseismology or exoplanets,
"massive" may just mean "with a convective main sequence core",
meaning a much lower threshold M_{ZAMS} \ge 1.2-1.3M_{\odot}.

At the very end of the evolution, the degenerate iron core is too
massive to be sustained by the electron degeneracy pressure, and
therefore it collapses under its own gravity, reaches (super--)nuclear
density (\rho\geq10^{14} g cm^{-3}), bounces due to the repulsive core of the
nuclear force (cf. [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org][lecture on microphysics of nuclear reactions]]) and
this triggers a shock-wave.

*N.B.:* The collapse and bounce is analogous to a ball bouncing off a
wall which momentarily compresses a bit and momentum changes sign in
the direction perpendicular to the wall progressively across the ball
volume. In this analogy, for a collapsing star, the wall is the inner
core reaching super-nuclear densities.

The shock wave launched is thought to explode the star, unbinding the
stellar envelope. However, historically (hydrodynamical) simulations
have had limited success in producing explosions. In most cases, the
shock just stops or reverts while still deep in the star. Therefore, a
``shock-revival'' mechanism (usually neutrino heating behind the shock
aided by asymmetries in the flow) is needed to push it further and
make it succeed in unbinding the stellar envelope.

The stellar structure (especially of the deepest layers) is paramount
for the success or failure of the SN explosion, especially the density
profile that the shock will encounter moving outward. But the details
of the stellar structure depend on the late burning stages (namely,
[[./notes-lecture-nuclear-cycles.org::*Silicon core burning][Silicon burning]]) of the star, and on the mixing processes during these
phases.

Several attempts to define a (small set of) parameter(s) describing
the pre-collapse core structure that could predict the outcome of the
simulation of a SN explosion (success or failure, NS or BH remnant)
have been made (e.g., [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...730...70O/abstract][O'connor & Ott 2011]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...818..124E/abstract][Ertl et al. 2016]], [[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190201340C][Couch et
al. 2019]]). Because the late burning phases and ultimately the
formation of the collapsing core itself is a multi-physics,
multi-scale, and likely stochastic problem, any attempt to define such
a parameter is necessarily an attempt to average and (over?) simplify
the structure ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.487.5304M/abstract][Mueller 2019]]).

The thermal state and composition of the iron core are of crucial
importance for the collapse itself: a slight variation in one of these
cause significant differences in the density profile of the star and
can in principle influence the outcome of the evolution (i.e.
successful explosion, or not). As an example, the amount of free
electrons in the core, which is quantified by $Y_e=1/\mu_{e}$:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
  Y_e=\ \sum_i \frac{Z_i}{A_i}X_i \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

enters quadratically in the effective Chandrasekhar
mass,

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Mcha}
  M_\mathrm{Fe} \geq M_\mathrm{Ch}^\mathrm{eff} \simeq (5.80 M_\odot) Y_e^2\left[1 +
    \left(\frac{s_e}{\pi Y_e}\right)^2\right]%1.44M_\odot(2 Y_e)^2 \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

that is the maximum mass that can be sustained by electron degeneracy
pressure, where s_{e} is the electrons specific entropy and the term
dependent on it is a "thermal correction" to account for the fact that
not the entire core is fully degenerate and with k_{B}T\ll\varepsilon_{Fermi}.

The dynamics of the collapse, and therefore the success or failure of
the explosion, depend on the structure (temperature, density, etc.)
and details of the composition of the core (see also [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...783...10S/abstract][Sukhbold &
Woosley 2014]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..227...22F/abstract][Farmer et al. 2016]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024RNAAS...8..152R/abstract][Renzo et al. 2024]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240902058L/abstract][Laplace et al.
2024]]).


* Physics of core collapse

** Core Bounce
Since the nuclei of the iron group are the most tightly bound, the
fusion of two of them would require energy input greater than the
energy released. Therefore, inside the iron core, fusion reactions
cannot compensate the energy loss of the star, and the core is doomed
to collapse. % under the influence of gravity. The conventional
definition for the onset of collapse is

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:onset_cc}
  \mathrm{max}\{ |v| \} \geq 10^3 \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where v is the radial infall velocity. The arbitrary threshold set by
Eq. \ref{eq:onset_cc} is motivated by the fact that, at this point, the
star is a few tenths of seconds (roughly a dynamical timescale) away
from ``core bounce'' (see below). The central density is so high ($\rho
\gtrsim 10^{10} \mathrm{ \ g \ cm^{-3}}$) that stellar evolution codes
usually cannot properly simulate the physics needed (e.g., the high
density regions require a different equation of state - EOS,
hydrostatic equilibrium does not hold any longer, neutrinos start to
be trapped because of the higher density and neutrino opacity).
However, this is a purely technical threshold, while in nature the
evolution of such a star is continuous during collapse.

During collapse, electron capture reactions, e.g.,

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ecap}
  p+e^-\rightarrow n+\nu_e \ \ , \ \ ^AZ+e^-\rightarrow ^A(Z-1)+ \nu_e \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

decrease Y_{e}, and diminishing $M_\mathrm{Ch}^\mathrm{eff}$ (see
Eq.~\ref{eq:Mcha}) accelerating the collapse further. Together with
positron capture reactions, electron capture reactions form the
so-called [[./notes-lecture-neutrinos.org::*Nuclear neutrinos][URCA process]], responsible for the lion's share of the
cooling (provided by neutrinos) during the collapse phase. As the
infall velocity progressively increases, the core divides into two
separate parts \cite{woosley:02}:

- *Inner Core*: in sonic contact and collapsing self-similarly (i.e.,
  the infall velocity |v| \propto r). Its mass is given by:
  #+begin_latex
   \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:InnerCoreMass} M_\mathrm{i.c.}=\int_{|v(r)|\leq c_s(r)}4\pi\rho(r) r^2 dr \ \ ,
  \end{equation}
  #+end_latex
  where c_{s} \equiv c_{s}(r) is the local sound speed, and the integral can
  be evaluated analytically assuming [[./notes-lecture-EOS2.org::*Ultra-relativistic electron gas][ultra-relativistic electron
  degeneracy]] dominates the pressure. The value of $M_\mathrm{i.c.}$ at
  core bounce is almost independent of the stellar progenitor and it
  is about $1\,M_\odot$ \cite{goldreich:80,yahil:82}.
- *Outer Core*: in supersonic collapse, because at lower density the
  sound speed c_{s} decreases, so no information about the inner core
  can reach into the outer core.

The collapse goes on until the central density is so high (\rho_{c}\sim10^{14}
g cm^{-3}) that the repulsive core of the nuclear force becomes relevant.
This repulsive contribution causes a sudden stiffening of the EOS, and
triggers the so-called core bounce, which is conventionally defined by
an arbitrary threshold on the specific entropy at the edge of the
inner core: s=3 (in units of the Boltzmann constant k_{B} times the
Avogadro number N_{A}). The inner core overshoots the equilibrium density
of the stiffened EOS, stops collapsing and reverses its radial
velocity. This launches a shock wave at the edge of the inner core. It
is thought that this shock wave at least in some cases, successfully
disrupts the star, producing a SN. However, in most cases, the shock
needs to be ``revived'' by some mechanism.

#+CAPTION: Velocity profile for the core of an initially 15 M_\odot star at the onset of core-collapse (left panel) at core bounce (right panel). Note the linear behavior of the infall in the inner core on the left panel. Note also the scales on the two panels: at the onset of core collapse, the infall velocity is still subsonic and directed inward (v<0) everywhere. The  data in the right panel are obtained using the open-source code GR1D, \cite{oconnor:10}, with the data at  the onset of core collapse as input. The energy source to drive the explosion is the gravitational binding energy released by the collapse of \sim1.4 M_{\odot} of Fe-rich material with radius of almost \sim1000 km to a proto-NS with radius of \sim10 km.

    M^2}{R_{\rm Fe}} \sim 10^{53}\,\mathrm{erg} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

The energy reservoir provided by the gravitational collapse is largely
in excess of the total binding energy of the stellar envelope, and
roughly speaking $100$ times more that the typical kinetic energy of a
SN explosions (1 Bethe \equiv 1 f.o.e. \equiv 10^{51} erg). Note that the energy
radiated away by a SN is typically a small fraction of the kinetic
energy ($\int L_\mathrm{SN}(t)\,dt \simeq10^{49}\,\mathrm{erg}$).

[[./images/shockR.png]]

As the shock wave propagates in the outer core, it loses energy by
heating and photodisintegrating the infalling material, and overcoming
the ram pressure (P_{ram }\simeq \rho v^{2}) of this same material.
Moreover, all the neutrinos that are not absorbed in the ``gain
region'' contribute to decreasing the total energy of the material
behind the shock. The energy loss through these mechanisms leads to a
stalled shock (the shock radius remains roughly constant for \sim0.1
millisec) in most simulations available to date. An uncertain ``shock
revival mechanism'' must act to revive the shock and restart its
radial expansion allowing it to unbind the stellar envelope and
produce a SN explosion.

In the /neutrino-driven paradigm/ (for reviews see \cite{janka:12,
vartanyan:22}), the shock is pushed by the large neutrino emission
from the hot proto-NS formed in the inner part of the bouncing inner
core. These neutrinos are mostly produced by electron captures to
``neutronize'' the Fe core (in the innermost ``cooling-region'' where
the proto-NS is), cf.~\Eqref{eq:ecap} and from [[./notes-lecture-neutrinos.org::*Thermal neutrinos][cooling processes]]. A
small fraction of these neutrinos will interact in a region behind the
shock (the so-called ``gain-region''). This is because the stellar
plasma has now densities and temperatures higher than during core Si
burning, and the cross section for neutrino absorption is not
negligible anymore.

Note, however, that other explosion mechanism relying less heavily on
the neutrino flux have been proposed. For instance, accretion on the
forming compact object in the inner core might trigger energetic jets
that might help pushing the shock, and this might be the dominant
explosion mechanism for long gamma ray bursts and SNIc showing broad
emission lines (i.e., very large ejecta velocities).

** Shock revival mechanisms
As mentioned above, historically, numerical simulations of
core-collapse SNe would always find stalling and ultimately receding
shocks, i.e. failed explosions. This lead to the realization that the
/asymmetries/ in the flow are a key ingredient to achieve a successful
explosion.

Several sources of asymmetry (both local and global) exist in the
collapsing core of a massive star:
- The neutrino heat the bottom of the gain region, driving convection
  (a steep temperature and entropy gradient can develop because of the
  neutrino heating);
- Convection implies the presence of turbulent flow and an associated
  turbulent pressure (P_{turb}\simeq \rho v_{turb}^{2}) that can help pushing
  the shock [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/\#abs/2018ApJ...865...81O][O'Connor et al. 2018]],
- Standing accretion Shock Instability (SASI, [[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...584..971B][Blondin et al. 2003]]):
  when the shock stalls its surface is perturbed by the infalling
  material. These perturbation (e.g., in terms of the local velocity)
  are advected downwards by convection and amplified which leads to a
  sloshing motion of the shock (although recently it was suggested
  that the growth time of this instability may be too long for it to
  play a role in successful explosions, where other mechanism revive
  the shock faster than SASI can develop, see [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...957...68B][Burrows et al. 2023]].)
- Lepton Emission Self-Sustained Emission (LESA, [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/\#abs/2014ApJ...792...96T][Tamborra et al 2014]]),
  found in 3D simulations where the neutrino emission is roughly
  dipolar.


The overall effect of asymmetries is to (i) increase the amount of
time spent by matter in the gain region, where the energy of the
neutrinos can be harvested and used to push the shock (ii) provide
extra pressure terms (e.g., due to turbulence). The combination of
these two should result, at least in some cases, in successful
explosions.


The first axisymmetric (i.e., 2D) simulations showed some successful
explosion, but it was soon realized that the symmetry imposed
artificially in these calculation was changing the turbulent cascade:
instead of dripping towards smaller scale and be dissipated at the
viscous scale, energy is pumped to larger scales in 2D, which
artificially helps the explosion.

[[./images/2v3dCCSN.png]]


As of early 2019, there is an emerging picture from the 3D
core-collapse SN simulations of different research groups ([[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...855L...3O][Ott et al.
2018]], [[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180101293K][Kuroda et al. 2018]]): /not only the asymmetries/ during the first
millisecond after core-bounce are necessary for successful explosions,
but also /the pre-collapse core-structure and in particular the Si/O
interface is crucial/.

The most massive stellar cores, for which the Si/O interface is at a
large Lagrangian mass coordinate, develop strong neutrino driven
convection, which together with the contribution of the turbulent
pressure drives a successful explosion with significant fallback and
result in the formation of a black hole.

Intermediate mass cores show a steep density gradient at the Si/O
interface: if the shock can reach this interface, it will
significantly accelerate outwards (because of mass continuity and the
drop in the impinging ram pressure). The neutrino driven convection
and turbulent pressure combined with the density drop result in
successful explosions with neutron star remnant. Smaller cores show
strong SASI oscillations of the shock and delayed explosions, likely
also resulting in NS remnants. However, note that the landscape on
explosion physics in the literature is itself very dynamic, with
multiple groups working on this problem and disagreeing on the
details.

*N.B.:* We have not mentioned /rotation/ and /magnetic fields/. These may
play an important role in the explosion mechanism -- certainly in
relatively more rare explosions such as long gamma-ray bursts, and
possibly for any explosion producing \ge10^{52} erg of energy. These are
also very active research topics, where our understanding of the
progenitor structure (in terms of angular momentum and magnetic
fields) is even more uncertain.

** Neutron star kicks
(put in context with Blaauw kick!)

#+CAPTION: Schematic of the development of a large asymmetry in a 3D CCSN simulation resulting in a large natal kick. From \cite{muller:17}.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[file:images/sketch_perturbations.png][./images/sketch_perturbations.png]]

The current understanding of core-collapse dynamics suggests that
asymmetries are likely the key to the success of the explosion. This
is further confirmed by the large velocities at which we observe some
single NSs moving. The proper motion of radio pulsars can correspond
to velocities in excess of \sim1000 km s^{-1}, which is much higher than the
maximum velocity at which we observe O and B type stars moving.

These are explained invoking an energy and momentum re-distribution
between the forming compact object and the SN ejecta allowed by the
asymmetries. One possible source of asymmetry is if the neutrino flux
from the cooling region is itself non-spherical, however, since the
proto-NS that occupies most of the volume of the cooling region is
convective with a convective turnover timescale faster than the
explosion, this explaination is currently disfavored. Another
possibility is that hydrodynamical instabilities lead to aspherical
flows.

A key prediction of this ``tug-boat'' model is that the SN shock is
faster in the direction opposite to the one in which the compact
object is accelerated. A faster shock is more efficient at
photodisintegrating nuclei, producing light particles that can be
accreted by the surviving nuclei: this model predicts stronger
explosive nucleosynthesis in the direction opposite to the compact
object. This prediction seems to be consistent with observations of
supernova remnant for which we can find the associated NS
\cite{holland-ashford:17,katsuda:18}. Note however, that recent
simulations from \cite{burrows:23_kick} disagree with this picture,
and produce sizable natal kicks just through momentum conservation in
asymmetric ejecta.

Whether the SN shock achieves a runaway radial growth (successful
explosion, cf.~black lines in \Figref{fig:shock}) or it stalls and
reverts (failed explosion, likely to result in BH formation) is
typically decided within the first few 100 millisec after core-bounce.
However, until few seconds after core-bounce the deeper layers of the
ejecta and the proto-NS are still dynamically connected, and interact
through gravity \cite{janka:13, burrows:23_kick}. If a clump of ejecta
is more dense because of asymmetries in the flow (a situation
routinely realized in 3D ab-initio simulations of the core-collapse
process), it can gravitationally pull the newly born compact object in
its direction and accelerate it.

Because of the SN kick, the kinetic energy of the compact object is
greatly increased, and this can lead to an increase of the total
(orbital) energy of a putative binary system:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  E_\mathrm{orb} =
  \frac{1}{2}M_1v_1^2+\frac{1}{2}M_2v_2^2-\frac{GM_1M_2}{a}
  \stackrel{\mathrm{SN}}{\rightarrow}
  \frac{1}{2}(M_1-M_\mathrm{ej})(v_1+v_\mathrm{kick})^2+\frac{1}{2}M_2v_2^2-\frac{GM_1M_2}{a}
  > 0
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

where we implicitly assume an instantaneous explosion (compared to the
orbital period of the binary), which leaves the gravitational
interaction term unchanged. If E_{orb} becomes positive, the binary
system is unbound. The SN kick thus breaks most massive binary systems
by giving a large velocity to the compact object, but without
modifying significantly the instantaneous velocity of the companion
star.

*N.B.:* Do not confuse v_{2} with the orbital velocity $v_\mathrm{orb} =
\sqrt{\frac{G(M_1+M_2)}{a}}$ which represents the velocity of the
point of reduced mass M_{1}M_{2}/(M_{1}+M_{2}) orbiting around the center of mass
of the binary, and not the velocity of a physical object!}
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  v_2 = \frac{M_1}{M_1+M_2}v_\mathrm{orb}\equiv\frac{M_1}{M_1+M_2}\sqrt{\frac{G(M_1+M_2)}{a}} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

The companion star is thus shot out of the binary with its
pre-explosion v_{2}, and if v_{2}>30 km s^{-1} it becomes a runaway star
\cite{renzo:19}. This however tends to happen rarely, since mass
transfer during the binary evolution tends to increase the separation
$a$, decrease the mass M_{1}, and increase the mass M_{2}.

Note typically SN ejecta achieve velocities of \sim10^{4} km s^{-1} \gg v_{orb},
thus we can neglect the orbital motion of the binary during the SN
(although see also \cite{batta:17}): effectively this corresponds to
an instantaneous loss of mass from the exploding star, which is not
the center of mass of the binary. This off-center mass loss (from the
point of view of the binary) is also referred to as or "Blaauw kick"
and can modify the orbit, and in extreme case where
$M_\mathrm{ejecta}\geq (M_1+M_2)/2$ it can change it from an
circle/ellipse to a parabola/hyperbole - so unbind the binary
\cite{blaauw:61}. Typically in massive binary evolution, the exploding
star loses its H-rich envelope to the companion long before its SN
explosion, therefore M_{ej} is rarely sufficiently large to unbind the
binary without a natal kick due to asymmetries.

From the observation of the pulsars proper motions we know that at
least some NS receive such large kicks, however there is still debate
on whether SN resulting in the formation of a BH can also provide
significant kicks, and consequently whether most BHs remain bound to
their stellar companion, or whether their formation breaks the
binaries in which they form. In at least a handful of cases, it can be
shown that large mass BHs were formed with negligible natal kicks
\cite{vigna-gomez:24}.

The observation of double pulsars \cite{hulse:75} also raises the
question of whether some successful SN explosion resulting in NS
formation might also lead to systematically smaller kicks, allowing
for a binary to survive two consequent explosions. The idea is that
ultra-stripped SNe (i.e. the explosion of a star that has lost a very
substantial amount of mass in multiple binary mass transfer episodes),
and/or electron-capture SNe\footnote{The least massive stars to
explode might never become hot enough to burn completely the oxygen
core, leaving a partially degenerate oxygen-neon-magnesium
composition. As this core contracts and cools through neutrino
emission, it reaches densities sufficient to trigger electron capture
on the nuclei of the core, decreasing the electron degeneracy pressure
support and triggering the core-collapse.} or core-collapse SN of
small Fe cores would more easily result in a successful explosion (no
shock stalling, and no time to develop significant asymmetries during
a shock stalling phase) with consequently small kicks.


** Importance of multi-dimensional treatment


** Light curves

*** Power sources
- $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}\rightarrow^{56}\mathrm{Co}\rightarrow^{56}\mathrm{Fe}$ decay power
- Interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) converting kinetic
  energy into radiation (\Rightarrow emission lines!)
- magnetar spin down

*** Scaling quantities

- From spectra v_{ejecta} \ge 10000 km s^{-1}
- Photosphere recedes in mass coordinate (expands in radius because of
  explosion though)
*** Type II SNe

*** Type I SNe

- Low ejecta mass \Rightarrow progenitors not luminous enough to self strip by
single star winds
- Shorter radiation diffusion time \Rightarrow faster decay time

[[./images/SN_taxonomy.png]]

The classification of supernovae (SNe), as many things in astronomy,
is rooted in history and was designed before the development of a
physical understanding of what is observed.

The "modern" version is based on a combination of /photometric/ and
/spectroscopic/ criteria which allow to classify transients observed in
the sky.

*N.B.:* the criteria are purely phenomenology-base and empirical!

The term "nova" in latin means "new" (omitting "star"), and in the
time of visual observations it was used for any new source appearing
in the sky. Keeping track of "changes" in the sky was especially
developed in Eastern Asian astronomy (and astrology), while it
received less attention in Western cultures where the dominant
Aristotelian philosophy postulated some "perfection" of the
"superlunar" world (and if it's perfect, why would it "change"?)

The term "supernova" was introduced by Baade and Zwicky in 1931 to
identify "new sources in the sky" with a particularly high luminosity.

The first step to classify transients is to look at Hydrogen lines in
the spectrum, and in absence of Hydrogen lines, whether there are
Silicon lines. No hydrogen and silicon is called a type Ia SN which is
theoretically associated to the thermonuclear obliteration of a white
dwarf (see corresponding project for more information, the rest of
this lecture will focus on massive stars explosions).

All other SN types are associated instead to the death of massive
stars: in absence of hydrogen lines and presence of helium lines we
speak of type Ib (so the progenitor star had no more H-rich envelope
at death), absence of both hydrogen and helium we have a type Ic
(progenitor stripped of H and He -- though a small amount of He may be
"hidden"). There is then a "transitional class" of type IIb SNe which
show H only very early on. Collectively type Ib/Ic/IIb are often
referred to as "stripped envelope SNe".

SNe showing hydrogen in their spectrum are called type II SNe.
Type II SNe are more common than stripped envelope ones, and they are
further classified base on the light curve:

 - type IIP showing a plateau (when the photosphere is locked by H recombination)
 - type IIL showing a linear decay in log(L) vs. time

Moreover, finer distinction and sub-classes exist, for example SNIIn,
Ibn, Icn which are SN with the conditions mentioned above also showing
narrow (\sim1000km s^{-1}) *emission* lines.

SNe are also said to be "super-luminous" if their absolute bolometric
magnitude exceeds M=-21 at peak.

** Supernova rates

The CCSN rate in Milky-way galaxies (with star formation rate of
approximately few M_{\odot} yr^{-1}) is about \sim 1 per century. We are
currently awaiting for one!

The figure below shows a breakdown per SN type:

** Current open questions

 - Neutron star or black hole?
 - If black hole, with or without explosion?
 - BH kicks?
