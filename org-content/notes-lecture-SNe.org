* Gravity's victory over nuclear energy release

"Massive stars" can be defined as those that will end their life forming
a compact object, either a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH).
This requires them to consume (at least partially) the oxygen-rich
core, that is, for the widest range of initial masses, to build a
silicon-rich core and subsequently iron-rich core that is too massive
to be sustained by the electron degeneracy pressure. This core is
therefore doomed to collapse under the influence of its own
self-gravity, and this can result in a successful supernova explosion.
For single massive stars, this happens for initial mass
$M_\mathrm{ZAMS}\gtrsim 7-10\,M_\odot$, depending on their metallicity and
rotation rate ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PASA...34...56D][Doherty et al. 2017]]). The presence of companions, which
is the rule rather than the exception ([[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Sci...337..444S][Sana et al. 2012]]), can also
change this threshold ([[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...601A..29Z][Zapartas et al. 2017]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850..197P/abstract][Poelarends et al. 2017]]).

At the very end of the evolution, the degenerate iron core is too
massive to be sustained by the electron degeneracy pressure, and
therefore it collapses because of gravity, reaches (super--)nuclear
density ($\rho\sim10^{14} \ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$), bounces due to the repulsive
core of the nuclear force and this triggers a shock-wave. This shock
wave is thought to explode the star, unbinding the stellar envelope.
However, historically (hydrodynamical) simulations have had limited
success in producing explosions. In most cases, the shock just stops
or reverts deep in the star. Therefore, a ``shock-revival'' mechanism
(usually neutrino heating behind the shock aided by asymmetries in the
flow) is needed to push it further and make it succeed in unbinding
the stellar envelope.

The stellar structure (especially of the
deepest layers) is paramount for the success or failure of the SN
explosion, especially the density profile that the shock will
encounter moving outward. But the details of the stellar structure
depend on the late burning stages (namely, Si burning) of the star, and on
the mixing processes during these phases.
% \subsection{The Compactness Parameter}

Several attempts to define a (small set of) parameter(s) describing
the pre-collapse core structure that could predict the outcome of the
simulation of a SN explosion (success or failure, NS or BH remnant)
have been made (e.g., \cite{oconnor:11, ertl:16, couch:19}). Because
the late burning phases and ultimately the formation of the
collapsing core itself is a multi-physics, multi-scale, and likely
stochastic problem, any attempt to define such a parameter is
necessarily an attempt to average and (over?) simplify the structure
\cite{muller:19}.

The thermal state and composition of the iron core are of crucial
importance for the collapse itself: a slight variation in one of these
cause significant differences in the density profile of the star and
can in principle influence the outcome of the evolution (i.e.\
successful explosion, or not).
As an example, the amount of free electrons in the core, which is quantified by $Y_e$:
\begin{equation}
  Y_e=\ \sum_i \frac{Z_i}{A_i}X_i \ \ ,
\end{equation}
enters quadratically in the effective Chandrasekhar
mass,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Mcha}
  M_\mathrm{Fe} \geq M_\mathrm{Ch}^\mathrm{eff} \sim (5.83 M_\odot) Y_e^2\left[1 +
    \left(\frac{s_e}{\pi Y_e}\right)^2\right]%1.44M_\odot(2 Y_e)^2 \ \ ,
\end{equation}
that is the maximum mass that can be sustained by electron degeneracy
pressure.


The dynamics of the collapse, and therefore the success or failure of
the explosion, depend on the structure (temperature, density, etc.)
and details of the composition of the core.
