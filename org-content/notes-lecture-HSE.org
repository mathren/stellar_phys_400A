** Spherical symmetry - onedimensional approximation
At zeroth-order, the dynamical elements that determine the structure
of a star are:

 - Gravity: the weight of the gas forming the star itself
 - Gas thermal pressure

Gravity is a central force that depends only on the radius (\prop r^{-2}),
and pressure is isotropic. Therefore at zeroth order, we expect stars
to be well approximated as /spheres/. This mathematically means that we
can express all the variables that characterize the structure of a
star as a function of a single variable, for example the radius from
the center of the star.

*** Questions
  - Discuss with your neighbor: can you think of cases where a star
    may not be spherical?

** Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates
In hydrodynamics one is typically interested in describing fields
(e.g., density, velocity, pressure, temperature, etc..). Let's call a
generic field \Psi. It can be described in two ways (well, they can also
be "combined" sometimes).

*** Eulerian description
In a Eulerian description the fields are described as a function of
space (and time): \Psi \equiv \Psi(x,y,z, t) in Cartesian coordinates or \Psi(r, \theta,
\varphi, t) in spherical-polar coordinates.

This is like looking at the flow from on top of a bridge at a fixed
position, describing the variables at that specific position.

For a star assuming spherical symmetry as discussed above, we would
have no dependence on the angular variables \partial_{\theta} \Psi \equiv
\partial_{\varphi}\Psi \equiv 0 and we could express \Psi\equiv\Psi(r, t).

*** Lagrangian description
In a Lagrangian description the fields are described as a function of
the fluid element, following the fluid element itself: \Psi \equiv\Psi(fluid
element, t)

This is like hopping on a boat that moves with the fluid, and
describing the properties of the fluid as the boat moves with it.

Because of the extremely large range of spatial scales in stellar
evolution (e.g., in the Sun from the center at r\simeq0 to the outer radius
r\simeq 7\times10^{11} cm, and in its future as a red giant 100-1000x larger),
compared to the limited range in mass (in the appropriate units 0-1
M_{\odot} for the Sun!), typically a Lagrangian description is preferred.
This means, for example we can chose as independent coordinate in the
star not the radius r, but instead the amount of mass enclosed by a
given radius m\equiv m(r), thus express \Psi(r,t) =\Psi(r(m), t)\rightarrow
\Psi(m(r), t).

This is what is typically done in stellar evolution, and it
works because the m(r) function is invertible, and it is in fact
monotonically increasing: as r increases, the amount of stellar mass
enclosed can also only increase!

** Mass conservation

Let's consider the amount of mass in a parcel of stellar gas. This will
depend on the local gas density \rho(r, t) (or equivalently in the
Lagrangian formalism \rho(m, t)!) and the amount of volume in the shell

dm = \rho dAdr

where dA is the element base area, and dr its radial thickness. We can
integrate over the base to get the parcel to be a spherical shell

\int dA = 4\pi r^{2}

where r is the radius of the shell, therefore

dm = 4\pi \rho r^{2} dr

In principle gas could also flow in/out of the shell at a rate
determined by the inflow/outflow velocity such that in a time interval
dt an amount \rho v dA dt flows in (for v>0) or out (v<0). Again
integrating over dA:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mass_continuity}
dm = 4\pi \rho r^{2} dr + 4\pi r^{2} \rho v dt
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

This is the complete mass continuity equation in spherical symmetry,
and the first stellar structure equation. It depends on a yet unknown
variable, the gas density \rho.

Typically, in a stellar evolution calculation the gas is in
hydrostatic equilibrium, \partial_{t} = 0.
