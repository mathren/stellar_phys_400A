#+title: 400A Projects

* Project/presentation
Each student will pick a topic to research based on textbooks, journal
articles, etc. from the list below and provide a short written summary
(\le 5 pages including figures and/or tables) and an oral presentation
to the classroom. This will allow each student to dig deeper into a
topic we cannot spend too much time in class, and at the same we can
all learn from each other.

*The text has to be submitted one week before the presentation is
scheduled*, and the *presentation is 10min+5min questions*. I _strongly_
recommend talking to me and/or Hailey at least 2 weeks (the earlier
the better!) before your written presentation is due to discuss
materials that you found and structure of the presentation.

** List of possible projects/presentations

If you have some other topic in mind, please come talk to me early on,
as we may be able to accommodate it.

1. Stellar rotation: observational evidence
2. Stellar rotation: angular momentum transport processes
3. Asteroseismology
4. Astrometry & the /Gaia/ mission
5. Tides in stars
6. Common envelope evolution
7. Roche model and mass transfer
8. Globular clusters: CMD
9. Globular clusters: dynamics
10. Formation of stars
11. Stars in galaxies: Chemical evolution
12. Stars in galaxies: Mechanical feedback
13. Stars in galaxies: Radiative feedback
14. s-process
15. r-process
16. X-ray binaries
17. Thermonuclear explosion in WDs
18. Neutron star structure
19. The Eddington limit
20. Convective boundary mixing
21. Gravitational waves
22. Nuclear reaction chains
23. Stellar winds: Parker model
24. Stellar winds: radiatively driven
25. Analytic stellar models: Lane-Emden equation
26. Analytic stellar models: Eddington standard model
27. Novae
28. Supermassive stars
29. Stellar neutrinos
30. From T_{eff} to color: bolometric corrections and extinction
31. Pair instability supernovae
32. Triple systems: Kozai-Lidov-von Zeipel oscillations
34.

** Grading
/This part is worth 40% of your final grade -- as much as all the
homework combined, so you want to do it well!/

Both text and presentations will be evaluated by the instructors /and/
your peers according to the evaluation rubric outlined below.

More specifically, the text will be evaluated by one other students
selected randomly, while the oral presentation and handling of the
questions will be evaluated by all the students present.

All students will be encouraged to ask questions during the
presentations. The questions and the way you provide your evaluations
and feedback to your peers will also be considered for your final
grading.

Of the project/presentation grade, 50% will come from the oral
presentation and QA (corresponding to 20% of the total final grade),
40% from the written report (corresponding to 16% of the total final
grade), and 10% from how you provide feedback to others (corresponding
to 4% of the total final grade).

*** Evaluation rubric

Remember to appreciate the time and effort others have put in their
work and be kind and constructive in providing feedback. The aim is to
learn and improve, not to crush other people's work. And also, nothing
is ever perfect, there is always something to be asked and/or
something that can be improved!
