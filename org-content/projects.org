* Project/presentation
Each student will be assigned a topic to research from the list below
and provide a short written summary (\le 5 pages including figures
and/or tables) and an oral presentation to the classroom. This will
allow each student to dig deeper into a topic we cannot spend too much
time on in class, and at the same we can all learn from each other!

*The text has to be submitted at least one week before the presentation
is scheduled*, and the *presentation is 10min+5min questions*. I _strongly_
recommend talking to me and/or Haley at least 2 weeks (the earlier the
better!) before your written presentation is due to discuss materials
that you found and the structure and content of the presentation.

** List of possible projects/presentations
If you have some other topic in mind, please come talk to me early on,
as we may be able to accommodate it.

** Recommended sources
You are encouraged to do your own research, but in the final
manuscript (and when appropriate in the oral presentation) you need to
cite all the relevant sources. These can be textbooks, review papers,
and/or journal articles. To find journal articles, you can use
[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/][NASA/ADS]]. You can use online freely-available resources (e.g.,
Wikipedia) as a starting point, but should go find /primary/ sources
(e.g., what Wikipedia itself cites, if not the references cited by the
source from Wikipedia, and so on...).

** Grading
/This part is worth 40% of your final grade -- as much as all the
homework combined, so you want to do it well!/

Both text and presentations will be evaluated by the instructors /and/
your peers according to the evaluation rubric outlined below.

More specifically, the text will be evaluated by two other students in
the class, while the oral presentation and handling of the questions
will be evaluated by all the students present. Your presence and
active participation in the presentation from other students is
required and will be counted towards the general in-class
participation.

All students will be encouraged to ask questions during the
presentations. The questions and the way you provide your evaluations
and feedback to your peers will also be considered for your final
grading.

The breakdown of the  project/presentation grade is as follows:
- 50% for the oral presentation and QA (corresponding to 20% of the total final grade)
- 40% for the written report (corresponding to 16% of the total final grade)
- 10% from how you provide feedback to others (corresponding to 4% of the total final grade).

*** Evaluation rubric

Remember to appreciate the time and effort others have put in their
work and be kind and constructive in providing feedback. The aim is to
learn and improve, not to crush other people's work. And also, nothing
is ever perfect, there is always something to be asked and/or
something that can be improved!

This counts for 40% of this assignment, corresponding to 16% of the
total grade.
