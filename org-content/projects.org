* Literature review project/presentation
The aim of this literature review project is for each student to
engage in a bit more depth with an important topic in modern stellar
physics /and/ explain it to the rest of the class. This is effectively a
literature review + exposition project, you are /not/ expected to produce new
results, but you should aim at digesting and being able to explain the
context, physical processes at play, and how they relate to the
material seen in class (during lectures, activities, and other student
presentations!).

*N.B.:* The aim of the project is for you to focus on the /physical
processes/ that are relevant and to put them in the context of the
course material to explain the rest of the class something.

Each student will be assigned a topic to research from the list below
and provide a short written summary (\le 5 pages including figures
and/or tables and references) and an oral presentation to the
classroom. This will allow each student to dig deeper into a topic we
cannot spend too much time on in class, and at the same we can all
learn from each other!

*The written text has to be submitted at least three lectures before the
presentation is scheduled*. The *oral presentation is 20min+10min
questions*. I _strongly_ recommend talking to me at least 3 weeks (the
earlier the better!) before your written presentation is due to
discuss materials that you found and the structure and content of the
presentation.


** Timeline

 - *Presentation day minus 3 lectures*: submission of manuscript to peer-referees
 - *Presentation day minus 2 lectures*: referees submit feedback
 - *Presentation day minus 1 lecture*: edited manuscript is submitted
 - *Presentation day*: Oral presentation (slides or whiteboard)

All files should be exchanged *in pdf* format, via email copying the instructor.
To make sure that your peers have time to read, provide feedback, and
incorporate that feedback, please adhere strictly to this timeline.
Any deviations need to be agreed upon by all parties.

** Procedure to assign projects
Each student will be asked identify 5 topics of interest from the list
below, and I will assign the research topic and the peer referees from
these lists. It may not be possible to satisfy each student's
preferences.

*** List of possible projects/presentations
If you have some other topic in mind, please come talk to me early on,
as we may be able to accommodate it.

37. The lowest mass stars: M dwarfs and Brown dwarfs
38. Something else within the scope of the course (*to be agreed upon*!)
39. Combination of topics above (*to be agreed upon*!)

** Recommended sources
You are encouraged to do your own research, but in the final
manuscript (and when appropriate in the oral presentation) you need to
cite all the relevant sources. These can be textbooks, review papers,
and/or journal articles. To find journal articles, you can use
[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/][NASA/ADS]]. You can use online freely-available resources (e.g.,
Wikipedia) as a starting point, but should go find /primary/ sources
(e.g., what Wikipedia itself cites, if not the references cited by the
source from Wikipedia, and so on...).

** Grading
/This part is worth 40% of your final grade -- as much as all the
homework combined, so you want to do it well!/

Both text and presentations will be evaluated by the instructors /and/
your peers according to the evaluation rubrics outlined below.

More specifically, the text will be evaluated by two other students in
the class, while the oral presentation and handling of the questions
will be evaluated by all the students present. Your presence and
active participation in the presentation from other students is
required and will be counted towards the general in-class
participation.

All students will be encouraged to ask questions during the
presentations. The questions and the way you provide your evaluations
and feedback to your peers will also be considered for your final
grading.

The breakdown of the  project/presentation grade is as follows:
- 50% for the oral presentation and QA (corresponding to 20% of the total final grade)
- 40% for the written report (corresponding to 16% of the total final grade)
- 10% from how you provide feedback to others (corresponding to 4% of the total final grade).

*N.B.*: Regardless of the quantitative weight of each portion towards
 the grade, your engagement is necessary for the success of the
 others. When refereeing your feedback should help them improve, and
 nobody wants to present to an absent audience!

*** Evaluation rubric

Remember to appreciate the time and effort others have put in their
work and be kind and constructive in providing feedback. The aim is to
learn and improve, not to crush other people's work. And also, nothing
is ever perfect, there is always something to be asked and/or
something that can be improved!

**** Written summary
This counts for 40% of this assignment, corresponding to 16% of the
total grade.

*N.B.:* You are not obliged to make slides, and you can use the
whiteboard if you think this fits better the presentation of your
topic.

*N.B.:* the aim of the feedback is to help the author improve their
presentation. You are asked to evaluate the work, /not/ the author. Give
clear and constructive criticism focusing on helping the presenter.

* Honors project

To get honors credits for this class, on top of the project described
above, you will do a stellar evolution theory project using the [[https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/][MESA]]
code on your own laptop to investigate in more depth some aspect that
we will only barely mention in class. [[./honors.org][Follow this link to see an
example honors project]].
