This is typically a very hard problem: as we have seen, on the HRD/CMD
there is a tight correlation between a star's magnitude and color at
least during the longest phase of its evolution, and there is one
single parameter that determines the position on a star on this
diagram. However, how do we determine what this parameter is, having
only these observational data? It is generally not possible without
relying on models. However, binaries can help!

** Binaries are common

The Sun is clearly not in a binary system. However, it is *not* uncommon
for stars to have gravitationally bound companions orbiting around
them, which can be of great help to determine their properties.

In fact, in this case we have two stars presumably born at roughly the
same time, presumably with the same initial composition, and we can
derive physical properties comparing them to each other.

Let's review some types of binaries.

*** Visual binaries

These are binaries that can be seen by naked eye. Typically this means
astrophysically very wide binaries that are unlikely to interact
beyond the fact that they are gravitationally bound and they orbit
each other. Nevertheless, they have an important historical role,
since Hershel observation of their motion of the sky over decades
proved that Kepler's law are valid beyond the Solar system.

Mitchell 1768 also used statistical argument that all the visual
binaries visible at the time could not be just chance alignment, and
instead had to be somehow physically related to each other.

A classic example are Mizar & Alcor in the Big Dipper: the ability of
finding the "double star" in this asterism was used as an eyesight
test to become an astronomer in Hellenistic times. The name Alcor
comes from the arabic for "hard to see"! Nowadays with modern
telescopes we can see that Mizar and Alcor are actually at least a
triple system, and there have been claims that it may be a quintuplet
even

*** Astrometric binaries

Wide binaries where one of the two stars is too faint to be seen can
still be found by looking at the peculiar motion of the star that can
be seen on the sky. What matters is its /proper motion/ (not the
apparent motion due to the Earth rotation) with respect to background
stars too far to be moving. For a single star, this is usually a
straight line (because the timescale for it to turn around the
Galactic center is typically \sim hundreds of millions of years).
However, if the star is in a binary, what moves along a straight line
is the center of mass of the binary! The /photocenter/ (i.e. the point
from where we can detect light) will "wiggle" around this straight
line due to orbital motion (and on top of the parallax periodic
wiggle).

This was first detected for the binary Sirius A and Sirius B by Bessel
in 1844 (the detection of photons from Sirius B followed in 1862 by
Clark). Nowadays, this is a very timely because of the precise
astrometric measurements by /Gaia/:

- this has been used to find /Gaia/ BH1 ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.518.1057E/abstract][El Badry et al. 2023a]]), BH2 ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.521.4323E/abstract][El
  Badry 2023b]]), and BH3 ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...686L...2G/abstract][Gaia Collaboration, Panuzzo et al. 2024]]):
  these systems have stars orbiting around an otherwise undetectable
  Black Hole!
- it can also be used to find stars in wide orbits around NS or other
  faint stars, and possibly even massive planets!

*** Spectroscopic binaries

**** SB1
In a spectrum, one star of the binary dominates, but we can see its
orbital motion as Doppler shifting of the spectral lines. Even if we
never see the less bright star, we can infer its presence from the
orbital motion of the brighter star.

*N.B.:* Radial velocity surveys that find massive and close-by planet
are effectively finding SB1 binaries made of a star and a planet!

**** SB2
These are spectroscopic binaries where both stars are contributing
light to the spectrum, meaning there will be two sets of spectral
lines that are periodically Doppler shifted in couter-phase.

*** Eclipsing binaries
These are binaries when at some point in the orbit one star passes in
front of the other. This blocks some of the light from one of the two
stars causing an eclipse and a dip in the light curve (i.e., the plot
of the luminosity of the system as a function of time).

This of course can only happen if the inclination of the orbital plane
of the binary w.r.t. the line of sight is not too large. Typically,
astronomers define the inclination of the orbital plane /i/ w.r.t. the
plane of the sky, therefore the line-of-sight (which is perpendicular
to the plane of the sky by definition) has an angle \varphi = \pi/2 - /i/ w.r.t.
the orbital plane. To have an eclipse, at least partial,

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation*}
\sin(\varphi) \leq \frac{R_{1} + R_{2}}{a} \ \ ,
\end{equation*}
#+end_latex

where we use that sin(\varphi)=cos(i), and a \times cos(i) is the projected
binary separation a on the plane of the sky, which is smaller than R_{1}+R_{2}
with R_{i} stellar radii, leads to an eclipse. The eclipse will be total
if

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation*}
\sin(\varphi) \leq \frac{R_{1} - R_{2}}{a}
\end{equation*}
#+end_latex

The time duration of an eclipse can be used to determine the radii of
the two stars. Consider the following figure:

#+CAPTION: Light cuve (visual magnitude as function of time) for an eclipsing binary with i=\pi/2, figure 7.9 in Carrol & Ostie's book
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/EB.png]]


one can see that, labeling with 2 the geometrically smaller star
(darker gray) and assuming the orbit to be circular and the semi-major
axis to be a and the period P:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
 \frac{t_{d} -t_{a}}{P} = \frac{2(R_{1}+R_{2})}{2\pi a} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

and

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
 \frac{t_{c} -t_{b}}{P}_{} = \frac{2(R_{1}-R_{2})}{2\pi a} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

These equations allow to calculate R_{j}_{}/a and if also the masses are
known also the individual radii R_{j} using Kepler's laws to get rid of
the orbital semi-major axis a.

:Questions:
 - *Q*: In the figure above, which star is assumed to be the hotter one?
 - *Q*: Can you see what happens to the light curve minima if we have an
   inclination of the binary orbit w.r.t. the plane of the sky?
:end:

** Dynamical mass determination
*** Visual binaries
Using Kepler's laws, we can use binaries to measure observationally
masses without relying on hard, expensive, and uncertain stellar
models.

In particular the third law can be written as

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Kepler3}
   G(M_{1}+M_{2}) = n^{2} a^{3} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

where M_{i} are the masses of the stars, n= 2\pi/P is the angular velocity
(aka "true anomaly") and a is the semimajor axis of the orbit (of the
orbit of the reduced mass point \mu = M_{1}M_{2}/(M_{1}+M_{2}) around the center of
mass).

For a visual binary (see above) where we can measure the semi-major
axes a_{i} of both stars around the center of mass, we also have another
equation that follows from the definition of center of mass:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:semimajor_axes}
 M_{1} a_{1} = M_{2} a_{2} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

where a_{1} + a_{2} = a. If we know the distance d to the binary (d \gg a, so
we can consider both stars at the same distance), then the angular
size of the ellipse that each stars traces on the orbit of the sky is
\alpha_{j} = a_{j}/d for j=1,2. In reality, the orbit is typically not on the
plane of the sky, but it has an inclination! This means what we can
see is not a_{j} but the projection of it on the plane of the sky a_{j}
sin(i). We can then solve these two equations for the individual
stellar masses (just having observations long enough to trace the
semi-major axes of wide visual binaries and knowing their distances,
for example because we have parallax measurements).

*N.B.:* even without knowing the distance d, using
Eq. \ref{eq:semimajor_axes} one can still determine the mass ratio q=M_{2}/M_{1}!

*** Spectroscopic (and eclipsing) binaries
In this case, we have access to more information thanks to the
variable "radial velocity/ies" (RV) of the stars, that is the
measurable Doppler shift of their spectral lines due to the orbital
motion.

However, what we can see though this is only the /projected/ orbital
motion along the line of sight (because we only get Doppler shift
along the line of sight), this is why the terminology is "radial
velocities": it's velocities along the radii of the celestial sphere
centered on the observer!

Following standard nomenclature, let's call z the direction of the
line of sight, using xy for the plane of the sky. By definition the
radial velocity of each star is dz/dt. \nu here is the true anomaly
(such that d\nu/dt = n), \omega is the argument of periastron - that is the
angle between the line of nodes (line where the plane of the sky,
assumed to contain the focus of the ellipse, and the plane of the
orbit intersect) and the direction of periastron.

#+CAPTION: Geometry of a binary orbit. This is Fig. 3.3 in Tauris & van den Heuvel 2023 book.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/bin_orbit.png]]


The one can calculate: z= rsin(i) sin(\nu+\omega) with r radius of the orbit
(which for an elliptical orbit is a function of time), the sin(i)
factor projects it on the plane of the sky and the sin(\nu+\omega) projects
on the line of sight. The radial velocity is therefore:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{dzdt}
\frac{dz}{dt} = \left(r \cos(\nu+\omega)\frac{d\nu}{dt}+\frac{dr}{dt}\sin(\nu+\omega)\right)\sin(i)
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

which using Kepler's second law

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Kepler2}
\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\frac{d\nu}{dt} = \frac{\pi ab}{P} = \frac{\pi a^{2} \sqrt{1-e^2}}{P} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where P is the orbital period, a and b are semi-major and semi-minor
axes, and

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
e = \sqrt{1-b^{2}/a^{2}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

is the eccentricity, and the relation between r\equiv r(\nu) for an ellipse:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{a(1-e^{2})}{1+e\cos(\nu)} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

one can finally rewrite the radial velocity from Eq. \ref{dzdt} as

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:vrad}
v_\mathrm{rad} = \frac{dz}{dt} = K (ecos(\omega)+cos(\omega+\nu)) \ \
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

where
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
 K = \frac{2\pi a\sin(i)}{P\sqrt{1-e^{2}}} \ \,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
is the so-called /semi-amplitude/ of the radial velocity, which apart
from the sin(i) factor depends only on observable quantities if one
can get spectra of many epochs (i.e., return to take spectra of the
same binary at many times, typically at least 7 spectra are required
for a decent fit to all these parameters):
 - P \rightarrow from the time interval between repeating identical spectra
 - e \rightarrow from the shape of the measured radial velocities as a function
   of time (i.e., radial velocity curve)
 - \omega \rightarrow similarly as e, it influences the shape of the radial velocity
   curve and can be deduced from it
 - asin(i) \rightarrow if the binary is SB2, then we can measure K_{1}\equiv K_{1}(a_{1})
   and K_{2}\equiv K_{2} (a_{2}) and use the relation between a_{1}+a_{2} = a to work
   out asin(i)
 - \nu \rightarrow this is less directly obtained by performing an orbital fit
   using other orbital parameters (mean anomaly and eccentric anomaly)

*N.B.:* In a real observation, one also needs to remove the component
along the line of site due to the motion of the Earth around the Sun,
and the peculiar motion of the Sun (i.e., v_{rad} from Eq. \ref{eq:vrad}
\rightarrow v_{rad}_{}-\gamma with \gamma peculiar velocity of the observer).

Therefore, for an SB2 binary we can observe dz_{j}/dt = v_{rad, j} for
each j=1,2 star, and we can determine K_{1} and K_{2}. using Eq.
\ref{eq:Kepler3} multiplied by sin^{3}(i) to make the projection of
the semi-major axis of the orbit on the line of sight, a \times sin(i):

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
   G(M_{1}+M_{2})\sin^{3}(i) = n^{2} a^{3} \sin^{3}(i) \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

and using \ref{eq:semimajor_axes} rewritten as

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
  \frac{a_{1} \sin(i)}{a_{2} \sin(i)} = \frac{M_{2}}{M_{1}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

we can solve for M_{j}sin^{3}(i), where except for the inclination angle of
the orbit, we have the masses! In the case of an /eclipsing SB2 binary/,
from the eclipses we can measure the inclination angle and obtain a
direct measurement of the masses. These are the most precise mass
measurements, which are only possible thanks to the occurrence in
nature of stellar binaries!

In the case of an SB1 binary, when only one spectrum is visible, we
can write

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
a = a_{1} +a_{2} = a_{1}(1 + \frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}) = a_{1} (1 + \frac{M_{2}}{M_{1}}) = a_{1} \frac{(M_{2} + M_{1})}{M_{2}} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

Thus, we can rewrite Eq. \ref{eq:Kepler3} \times sin^{3}(i) as

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
 (M_{1} +M_{2}) \sin^{3}(i) \frac{M_{2}^{3}}{(M_{1} +M_{2})^{3}} = \frac{n^{2}}{G}a_{1}^{3} \sin^{3}(i) \ \,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

where the r.h.s. depends only on observables, and thus this allow us
to derive observationally the mass function

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
f(M_{1}, M_{2}) = \frac{M_{2}^{3 }\sin^{3}(i)}{(M_{1} + M_{2})^{2}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

which together with an estimate of the mass-ratio provides a limit on M_{2}.

** Mass-luminosity relation
Using systems for which this mass measurements are possible, we can
derive an empirical mass-luminosity relation. In the best astronomical
tradition, this was initially fit with a powerlaw, but as the range of
stellar masses explored grew, this became a broken powerlaw:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
 L \propto M^{x}
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

with x=4 for M\le0.8M_{\odot}, x=3 for 0.8M_{\odot} <M<50M_{\odot}, x=1 for M\geq
50M_{\odot}. These thresholds are extremely approximated, probably
metallicity dependent, as we will possibly see later in the course.
Moreover, and importantly, these hold only for so-called "main
sequence" stars, the one following also the L(T_{eff}) relatively tight
relation on the color-magnitude diagram: evolved stars are a different
problem!

* Homework

** Exercise 7.4 on Carroll & Ostie

 Sirius is a visual binary with a period of 49.94 yr. Its measured
 trigonometric parallax is 0.37921" \pm 0.00158" and, assuming that the
 plane of the orbit is in the plane of the sky, the true angular
 extent of the semimajor axis of the reduced mass is 7.61". The ratio
 of the distances of Sirius A and Sirius B from the center of mass is
 a a_{A} /a_{B} = 0.466.

  1. Find the mass of each member of the system.
  2. The absolute bolometric magnitude of Sirius A is 1.36, and Sirius B
     has an absolute bolometric magnitude of 8.79. Determine their
     luminosities. Express your answers in terms of the luminosity of
     the luminosity of the Sun
  3. The effective temperature of Sirius B is approximately 24790 K \pm
     100 K. Estimate its radius, and compare your answer to the radii
     of the Sun and Earth. What kind of star is that hot with that radius?

** Exercise 7.6 on Carroll & Ostie
 From the light and velocity curves of an eclipsing, spectroscopic
 binary star system, it is determined that the orbital period is 6.31
 yr, and the maximum radial velocities of Stars A and B are 5.4 km s^{-1}
 and 22.4 km s^{−1}, respectively. Furthermore, the time period between
 first contact and minimum light (t_{b} − t_{a}) is 0.58 d, the length
 of the primary minimum (t_{c}− t_{b}) is 0.64 d, and the apparent
 bolometric magnitudes of maximum, primary minimum, and secondary
 minimum are 5.40 magnitudes, 9.20 magnitudes, and 5.44 magnitudes,
 respectively. From this information, and assuming circular orbits,
 find:
 1. Ratio of stellar masses
 2. Sum of the masses (assume i = 90 degrees)
 3. Individual masses
 4. Individual radii (assume that the orbits are circular)
 5. Ratio of the effective temperatures of the two stars
