This is typically a very hard problem: as we have seen, on the HRD/CMD
there is a tight correlation between a star's magnitude and color at
least during the longest phase of its evolution, and there is one
single parameter that determines the position on a star on this
diagram. However, how do we determine what this parameter is, having
only these observational data? It is generally not possible without
relying on models.

However, binaries can help!
