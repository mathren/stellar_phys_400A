* Measuring masses
*Materials*:

This is typically a very hard problem: as we have seen, on the HRD/CMD
there is a tight correlation between a star's magnitude and color at
least during the longest phase of its evolution, and there is one
single parameter that determines the position on a star on this
diagram. However, how do we determine what this parameter is, having
only these observational data? It is generally not possible without
relying on models.

However, binaries can help!

** Binaries are common

The Sun is clearly not in a binary system. However, it is *not* uncommon
for stars to have gravitationally bound companions orbiting around
them, which can be of great help to determine their properties.

In fact, in this case we have two stars presumably born at roughly the
same time, presumably with the same initial composition, and we can
derive physical properties comparing them to each other.

Let's review some types of binaries

** Visual binaries

These are binaries that can be seen by naked eye. Typically this means astrophysically
very wide binaries that are unlikely to interact beyond orbiting each
other, but they have an important historical role, since Hershel
observation of their motion of the sky over decades proved that
Kepler's law are valid beyond the Solar system.

Mitchell 1768 also used statistical argument that all the visual
binaries visible at the time could not be just chance alignment, and
instead had to be somehow physically related to each other.

A classic example are Mizar & Alcor in the Big Dipper: the ability of
finding the "double star" in this asterism was used as an eyesight
test to become an astronomer in Hellenistic times. The name Alcor
comes from the arabic for "hard to see"! Nowadays with modern
telescopes we can see that Mizar and Alcor are actually at least a
triple system, and there have been claims that it may be a quintuplet
even

** Spectroscopic binaries

*** SB1
In a spectrum, one star of the binary dominates, but we can see its
orbital motion as Doppler shifting of the spectral lines. Even if
