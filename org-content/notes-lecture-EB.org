This is typically a very hard problem: as we have seen, on the HRD/CMD
there is a tight correlation between a star's magnitude and color at
least during the longest phase of its evolution, and there is one
single parameter that determines the position on a star on this
diagram. However, how do we determine what this parameter is, having
only these observational data? It is generally not possible without
relying on models.

However, binaries can help!

** Binaries are common

The Sun is clearly not in a binary system. However, it is *not* uncommon
for stars to have gravitationally bound companions orbiting around
them, which can be of great help to determine their properties.

In fact, in this case we have two stars presumably born at roughly the
same time, presumably with the same initial composition, and we can
derive physical properties comparing them to each other.

Let's review some types of binaries.

*** Visual binaries

These are binaries that can be seen by naked eye. Typically this means astrophysically
very wide binaries that are unlikely to interact beyond orbiting each
other, but they have an important historical role, since Hershel
observation of their motion of the sky over decades proved that
Kepler's law are valid beyond the Solar system.

Mitchell 1768 also used statistical argument that all the visual
binaries visible at the time could not be just chance alignment, and
instead had to be somehow physically related to each other.

A classic example are Mizar & Alcor in the Big Dipper: the ability of
finding the "double star" in this asterism was used as an eyesight
test to become an astronomer in Hellenistic times. The name Alcor
comes from the arabic for "hard to see"! Nowadays with modern
telescopes we can see that Mizar and Alcor are actually at least a
triple system, and there have been claims that it may be a quintuplet
even

*** Astrometric binaries

Wide binaries where one of the two stars is too faint to be seen can
still be found by looking at the peculiar motion of the star that can
be seen on the sky. What matters is its /proper motion/ (not the
apparent motion due to the Earth rotation) with respect to background
stars too far to be moving. For a single star, this is usually a
straight line (because the timescale for it to turn around the
Galactic center is typically millions of years). However, if the star
is in a binary, what moves along a straight line is the center of mass
of the binary! The /photocenter/ (i.e. the point from where we can
detect light) will "wiggle" around this straight line due to orbital
motion (and on top of the parallax periodic wiggle).

This was first detected for the binary Sirius A and Sirius B by Bessel
in 1844 (the detection of photons from Sirius B followed in 1862 by
Clark). Nowadays, this is a very timely because of the precise
astrometric measurements by /Gaia/ (see recent review by [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387647324000010?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8abf0b7a7c0115f3][El Badry 2024]]):

- this has been used to find /Gaia/ BH1, BH2, and BH3: these systems
  have stars orbiting around an otherwise undetectable Black Hole!
- it can also be used to find stars in wide orbits around NS or other
  faint stars, and possibly even massive planets!

*** Spectroscopic binaries

# possibly add fig. 2.3 from Tauris & van den Heuvel's book

**** SB1
In a spectrum, one star of the binary dominates, but we can see its
orbital motion as Doppler shifting of the spectral lines. Even if we
never see the less bright star, we can infer its presence from the
orbital motion of the brighter star.

*N.B.:* Radial velocity surveys that find massive and close-by planet
are effectively finding SB1 binaries made of a star and a planet!

**** SB2
These are spectroscopic binaries where both stars are contributing
light to the spectrum, meaning there will be two sets of spectral
lines that are periodically Doppler shifted in couter-phase.

*** Eclipsing binaries
These are binaries when at some point in the orbit one star passes in
front of the other. This blocks some of the light from one of the two
stars causing an eclipse and a dip in the light curve (i.e., the plot
of the luminosity of the system as a function of time).

This of course can only happen if the inclination of the orbital plane
of the binary w.r.t. the line of sight is not too large. Typically,
astronomers define the inclination of the orbital plane /i/ w.r.t. the
orbital plane, therefore the line-of-sight (which is perpendicular to
the plane of the sky by definition of plane of the sky) has an angle \varphi
= \pi - /i/ w.r.t. the orbital plane. To have an eclipse, at least partial,

#+begin_src tex
\sin(\varphi) \leq \frac{R_{1} + R_{2}}{a}
#+end_src tex

with R_{1}, R_{2} radii of the stars, and a their orbital separation. The
eclipse will be total if

#+begin_src tex
\sin(\varphi) \leq \frac{R_{1} - R_{2}}{a}
#+end_src tex

** Dynamical mass determination

*** Visual binaries
Using Kepler's laws, we can use binaries to measure observationally
masses without relying on hard, expensive, and uncertain stellar
models.

In particular the third law can be written as

#+begin_src tex label:Kepler3
 G(M_{1}+M_{2}) = n^{2} a^{3}
#+end_src

where M_{i} are the masses of the stars, n= 2\pi/P is the angular velocity
and a is the semimajor axis of the orbit (of the orbit of the reduced
mass point \mu = M_{1}M_{2}/(M_{1}+M_{2}) around the center of mass).

For a visual binary (see above) where we can measure the semi-major
axes a_{i} of both stars around the center of mass, we also have another
equation that follows from conservation of momentum:

#+begin_src tex
 \frac{M_{1}}{a_{1}} = \frac{M_{2}}{a_{2}}
#+end_src

We can then solve these two equations for the individual stellar
masses (just having observations long enough to trace the semi-major
axes of wide visual binaries).
