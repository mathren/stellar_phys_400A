* Neutrino physics in stars
*Materials:* Sec. 6.5 and 12.3.1 of Onno Pols' notes.

We have almost seen all the pieces needed to make a one-dimensional
hydrostatic model of a star, including the input physics in the
quantities \kappa (opacity) and \varepsilon_{nuc}. The aim of this lecture is to unpack
the last input quantities entering in the energy conservation which
connects stellar physics with neutrino physics: \varepsilon_{\nu.}

** Summary of equations we have derived

*** Mass conservation
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mass_cont}
\frac{dr}{dm} = \frac{1}{4\pi r^{2}\rho}\ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

*** Hydrostatic equilibrium
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HSE}
\frac{dP}{dm} = -\frac{Gm}{4\pi r^{4}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which follows from the momentum conservation equation

*** Equation of state
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
P_\mathrm{tot} = P_\mathrm{gas} + P_\mathrm{rad} = \frac{\rho}{\mu m_{u}}k_{B}T + P_{QM} + \frac{1}{3}aT^{4}  \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

*** Energy transport
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dm} = \frac{T}{P}\frac{dP}{dm}\nabla
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where \nabla =\partial log(T)/\partial log(P) is the local temperature gradient, equal to
the radiative gradient in stably stratified regions:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\nabla \equiv \nabla_\mathrm{rad} = \frac{3 P}{14\pi acGm T^{4}}\kappa L
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
with \kappa = (1/\kappa_{rad} + 1/\kappa_{cond})^{-1} the combination "in parallel" of the
radiative and conductive opacity (assumed to be known from atomic
physics), and \nabla \equiv \nabla_{ad} the adiabatic gradient (within \sim10^{-7-8}
precision) for convective regions. We also have a criterion
(Schwarzschild criterion) to determine which region is which.

*** Energy conservation
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dm} = \varepsilon_\mathrm{nuc} -\varepsilon_{\nu} + \varepsilon_\mathrm{grav} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

with \varepsilon_{grav} = T\partial s/\partial t the change in internal energy and \varepsilon_{\nu}>0.

** Two types of neutrinos

For the \rho typical in stars (think of \langle\rho_{\odot}\rangle and the other
average densities you estimated in the various homeworks), neutrinos
can safely be considered as non-interacting.

Moreover, for distances smaller than the typical stellar radii
(generously r\le1000R_{\odot}), we can also neglect the physics of neutrino
oscillations and consider neutrinos as ultra-relativistic mass-less
particles propagating at v \simeq c. Neglecting the neutrino masses also
allows us to assume conservation of the leptonic number throughout
stellar evolution.

*N.B.:* recall that the leptonic number is +1 for the leptons electron
e^{-}, muon \mu^{-}, tau \tau^{-} and the corresponding neutrinos \nu_{e}, \nu_{\mu},
\nu_{\tau} and -1 for their antiparticles positron e^{+}, positive muon \mu^{+},
and positive \tau^{+} and the corresponding antineutrinos.

Therefore, any neutrino produced in the stellar interior leaves the
star in the light-crossing time R/c \le 1000 R_{\odot}/c \simeq 1000 \times
2 sec = 2000 sec which is much shorter than evolutionary timescales
(and even during shorter evolutionary phases such as silicon shell
burning, the energy carried by the neutrinos is on its way out and
nothing is going to stop it from leaving the star).

These arguments apply to both kinds of neutrinos that we can encounter
in stellar evolution, and stop working only when densities get
extremely high (\rho\ge10^{10} g cm^{-3}): at this point neutrinos can and do
start interacting with matter. Such densities are only encountered in
a collapsing core that has exhausted nuclear fuel and in neutron
stars: neutrino interactions are crucial to the physics of the
supernova explosions, but can safely be neglected before.

During the evolution of the star that sets the stage for the
explosion, we encounter two "classes" of neutrinos.

*** Nuclear neutrinos
We have already encountered processes occurring in stars: /weak
nuclear reactions/! These are needed since the main sequence (both in
the pp chain and CNO) to convert some protons into neutrons for the
helium nuclei.

These neutrinos do carry away energy as described above, /but/ that is
just some of the energy that the exo-energetic thermonuclear reaction
would have released. Effectively, they decrease the energy gain from
releasing nuclear binding energy but they are not a net energy loss.

This allows to incorporate them in models by re-writing \varepsilon_{nuc}
\rightarrow \varepsilon_{nuc} - |\varepsilon_{\nu, nuc}|, where the neutrino term is always negative
(hence we can write it as minus an absolute value), and needs to be
calculated from nuclear physics, determining the spectrum of the
neutrino produced by a given reaction (a non-trivial task which
stellar physics leaves to neutrinos and nuclear physicists).

Particularly important for the late evolution of massive stars are
neutrinos from the so-called /URCA processes/ (named after a casino in
Rio de Janeiro because when these processes kick in the energy of the
nuclear reaction goes the same way as the money in the casino!):
#+begin_latex
$ ^{A}Z+e^{-}\rightarrow^{A}(Z-1) + \nu_{e }$\\
$ ^{A}(Z-1)\rightarrow ^{A}Z +e^{-}+\bar{\nu_{e}} $
#+end_latex

which produce one neutrino and one anti-neutrino without changing the
composition of the star. This requires that the nucleus $^{A}(Z-1)$ is
unstable to \beta^{-}-decay and the cross section for electron capture on
$^AZ$ is non-negligible, which can happen during Si core burning and
the subsequent gravitational collapse of the core once the nuclear
fuel runs out.

The nuclear neutrinos are mostly sensitive to the core temperature for
the activation of certain thermonuclear reaction chains (except for
pycno-nuclear reaction at extremely high densities where the electron
screening effectively makes the Coulomb barrier negligible).

*** Thermal neutrinos
After helium core burning, the density in the stellar cores become
sufficiently high (because of the gravothermal collapse) that
non-nuclear processes producing neutrinos start occurring. After
carbon depletion, the neutrinos produced by these processes can take
away more energy than is locally lost to photons by each stellar
layer: /evolved massive stars are neutrino stars/ L_{\nu}
\gg L_{rad} ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1968Ap%26SS...2...96F/abstract][Fraley 1968]]).

This also effectively means that the stellar core of evolved (\sim during
and after carbon core burning) massive stars is /decoupled/ from the
stellar envelope: the /gravothermal collapse of the core occurs to
compensate the neutrino losses from the core itself/! The thermal
timescale of the core becomes \tau_{KH,\nu}\simeq GM_{core}^{2}/(2R_{core} L_{\nu}) and
the nuclear timescale becomes \tau_{nuc,\nu} = \phi f_{burn} Mc^{2}/L_{\nu} both of which
are much shorter than the timescales in the low density, photon-cooled
envelope: in the late stages of stellar evolution the envelope should
be /frozen/ and the core evolves driven by neutrino losses.

*N.B.:* it is still the energy losses driving the gravothermal collapse
because of the virial theorem that govern the evolution, but the
envelope does not have time to keep up with the core.

*N.B.:* recently, observations of early signals of stellar explosion
have questioned this picture of /frozen/ envelope: there /may/ be some
presently unknown phenomena happening on a /dynamical/ timescale of the
envelope in the final years/months of a massive star evolution that
affect the envelope. The fact that they /need to be dynamical/ to do
anything is related to the fact that the evolution of the core is sped
up by the thermal neutrino losses.

The neutrinos that do /not/ come from nuclear reactions are a real
energy /loss/ term for the star that enter in the local energy
conservation equation \varepsilon_{\nu}_{} (which is also always negative!): dL/dm =
\varepsilon_{nuc} - |\varepsilon_{\nu}| +\varepsilon_{grav}.

The /thermal/ processes producing these neutrinos typically will produce
a neutrino-antineutrino /pair/ to conserve the leptonic number.
Typically only electron neutrinos will be relevant: leptons other than
e^{\pm} are unstable and are not commonly found in stars. They fall into
several categories:

  - plasmon processes: $\gamma + \tilde{\gamma} \rightarrow \nu_x + \bar{\nu}_x$,
  - bremsstrahlung: $e^{-} + ^{A}Z \rightarrow e^{-} + ^{A}Z + \nu_x + \bar{\nu}_x$,
  - pair-production: $\gamma + \gamma \rightarrow \nu_x + \bar{\nu}_x$,
  - pair annihilation:  $e^{+}+e^{-} \rightarrow \nu_x + \bar{\nu}_x$ ,
  - photo-processes: $\gamma +e^{-} \rightarrow e^{-} + \nu_x + \bar{\nu}_x$,

*N.B.:* "plasmons" are collective excitations of the stellar plasma that
propagate (the analogy is with "solitons" in fluid dynamics).

*N.B.:* The Feynman diagrams of some of these processes above are
illustrating the processes (and the various pieces that contribute in
the quantum field theory calculation of the cross section), the
particles that are not "free legs" are mediators and not real
particles, do not over-interpret these diagrams as physical pictures!

Neutrino cooling processes are mostly sensitive to the core density \rho.
The typical energy carried away per neutrino-antineutrino pair is of
the order of the thermal energy of the electrons (i.e., their Fermi
energy if the region from where the neutrinos are emitted is partially
degenerate).

Lke \kappa and \varepsilon_{nuc}, the energy losses to thermal neutrinos are usually
tabulated in stellar physics codes (see especially the widely used
[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJS..102..411I/abstract][Itoh et al. 1996]]), and the figure below shows the |\varepsilon_{\nu}|
\equiv |\varepsilon_{\nu}|(T,\rho) resulting from these tables:

* Principles of computational stellar evolution

We now have finally derived/discussed all the pieces of physics
necessary to compute a stellar /structure/ model, treat its nuclear
energy generation and thus driving its /evolution/.

The description we have obtained for a spherically symmetric star is
made of 4 non-linear, coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODE)
plus the equation of state that in a sense acts as closure condition
for the system. Solving these equations we can:
 1. study the interior structure of modelled stars and try to learn about
    the parts of the star that are not accessible to direct
    observations (hidden inside the photosphere)
 2. study the time evolution of modelled stars, which we cannot
    observe for real stars since most evolve way too slow for us to
    follow within our lifetimes.

*N.B.:* without the assumption of spherical symmetry, the equations
would become partial differential equations (PDE). When introducing
effects such as rotation or binarity that formally break the spherical
symmetry of the problem, these are "cast" in a form that still allows
a 1D formalism (e.g., "shellular rotation" assuming that all
quantities are constant along isobars and uses P as the independent
coordinate, or using volume-weighted equivalent potentials of the
companion).

As you can imagine, this is not a system easily solved by hand. Since
the early days of the availability of computers in the 1960s, people
have been designing and leveraging /computational techniques/ to
/numerically/ solve this system of equations. For the rest of this
lecture, we are going to discuss some general principles behind these
computational techniques.

** The most important thing to remember when using codes

:Quote:
"/Traditional scientific knowledge has generally taken the form of/
/either theory or experimental data. However, where theory and/
/experiment stumble, simulations may offer a third way./" - Simulation,
Johannes Lenhard et al.
:end:

Computational techniques take a system of equations describing a
physical models (for example the equations we have derived), which
already rely on a whole variety of physical approximations (e.g.,
spherical symmetry, LTE, free-streaming neutrinos, etc.), and apply a
whole new set of /numerical/ approximations to obtain a numerical
solution.

Presumably, nature does not do /any/ of this: without opening the
philosophical question of whether nature writes down equations to
solve, it certainly does not need to do physical approximations (while
we need to be able to reason on a problem), and even less the
/numerical/ approximations needed to solve the equations. At ontological
level, numerical simulations are /not/ equivalent to empirical evidence!
Never trust numerical results as if they were ground truth: a computer
will only do what it is told, and we tell it our physically and
numerically approximated best guess for what we are trying to simulate
which is /not/ what nature empirically provides. I emphasize this as a
person who spends most of his time getting numerical results! Note
also how this is more general than /just/ stellar physics: this applies
to /any/ computational physics field.

The /high non-linearity/ of the system means that there can be
quasi-chaotic behavior: a small perturbation (maybe because of a
numerical error or a small inconsistency in the tabulated input
physics!) can cascade into dramatic consequences, similar to the
famous "butterfly effect" (which was also theorized from numerical
computations, but of atmospheric physics, by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz][E. Lorenz]]).
