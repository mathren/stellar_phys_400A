* Photons, neutrinos, and gravitational-wave astronomy

Astronomy since its inception lost in history is based on observations
of (visible) light from sources in the Sky. As mentioned in [[./notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.org][at the
beginning]], between the 17^{th} and 19^{th} century astronomy was unified
with physics (universal law of gravitation and spectra). In the 20^{th}
century, the wavelength range accessible to telescopes greatly
increased (from high-energy \gamma-rays to long radio wavelengths), making
astronomy a /multi-wavelength/ science.

With the detection of neutrinos (first solar, then from SN1987A, and
most recently very high-energy neutrinos), astronomy became
"multi-messenger" (photons+neutrinos), a buzz word that is highly used
presently.

The addition of gravitational waves (GW) discussed today adds a completely
new way to look at astrophysical sources, probing optically thick and
thus inaccessible regions, and regimes where gravity is /strong/ (i.e.,
a full general relativistic treatment of the interaction of matter
with space-time becomes necessary).

Because the wavelength range for GWs (which are /not/ EM waves nor sound
waves!) accessible to presently available ground-base detectors such
as LIGO/Virgo/Kagra is in the 10-1000Hz range -- corresponding roughly
to the auditory range for typical human hears, it is often
metaphorically said that GWs allow us to "hear" the Universe.

* GW basics

The fact that there is a finite speed $c$ for the propagation of
interaction fields allows for the existence of unbound /gravitational/
fields. An oscillating unbound gravitational field is by definition a
gravitational wave. GWs, as any /wave/, are the solution of a linear
perturbation on a state. In the GW case, the state is the flat
space-time metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ describing space-time far away from any
mass, and the perturbation, often indicated with $h_{\mu\nu}$.

Let's start from Einstein's field equation:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EFE}
G_{\mu\nu }_{}+ \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = T_{\mu\nu} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric (the unknown functional variable),
$T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor that describes the distribution
of matter/energy that shapes space-time (i.e., the source term which
determines $g_{\mu\nu}$), and $G_{\mu\nu}=R_{\mu\nu} - 0.5Rg_{\mu\nu}$ is
Einstein's tensor, and the indexes $\mu$ and $\nu=0,1,2,3$ span the
temporal and three spatial dimensions. In vacuum $T_{\mu\nu} = 0$, and we
can assume to have a solution $g_{\mu\nu}$ and apply a small perturbation
to it: $g_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow g_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}$. Keeping only terms
linear in $h_{\mu\nu}$ (which is our new functional variable) we can
rewrite Eq. \ref{eq:EFE} as:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EFE}
\nabla^{2} -\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial t^{2}} h_{\mu\nu} = 0 \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which is a wave equation in three dimensions for $h_{\mu\nu}$ with speed
of propagation $c$. Consequently, $h_{\mu\nu}$ admits oscillating
solutions! These are the "ripple in space-time" (i.e., in the metric
tensor describing the properties of space-time in general relativity)
as GWs are often described.

** Sources of GWs

 - Source terms require at least the second-order moment of the mass
   distribution (first order is momentum of the source and can be set
   to zero with a choice of reference frame, order zero is the mass
   which is constant): binaries or asymmetric mass distributions
 - GW amplitude $\propto 1/r$ (vs. EM amplitude $\propto 1/r^{2}$), we can detect GWs
   from a much wider volume
 - GW amplitude scales with chirp mass \mathcal{M}\equiv\mathcal{M}(M_{1}, M_{2})

** Indirect detection of GWs

  [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975ApJ...195L..51H/abstract][Hulse & Taylor 1975]] discovered the first pulsar (radio source
  repeating with very high precision interpreted physically as a
  neutron star rotating fast) in a binary system, PSR B1913+16 (a.k.a.
  "Hulse-Taylor pulsar"). They showed a radial velocity curve (recall
  [[./notes-lecture-BIN.org][the lecture on binary orbital motion]]) which demonstrated the orbit
  is eccentric and the companion is another compact object.

  Monitoring this system, and measuring the delay between periastron
  passage observed and the periastron passage predicted with a
  Keplerian orbit, one can see that the period is progressively
  speeding up, or, in other words, the orbit is shrinking in time.

  #+CAPTION: Dots are the measured cumulative time shift in periastron passage w.r.t. a Keplerian orbit with constant period for PSR B1913+16. The solid line is the prediction assuming the period is changing due to GW emission as predicted by general relativity. Note that this is *not* a fit!

  The measured agreement between the period decay of the Hulse-Taylor
  pulsar and general relativity prediction of the energy loss due to
  GW emission is considered the first /indirect/ evidence for GW (and
  was awarded the Nobel prize in 1993).
