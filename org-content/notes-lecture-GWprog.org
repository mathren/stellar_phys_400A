* Photons, neutrinos, and gravitational-wave astronomy

Astronomy since its inception lost in history is based on observations
of (visible) light from sources in the Sky. As mentioned in [[./notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.org][at the
beginning]], between the 17^{th} and 19^{th} century astronomy was unified
with physics (universal law of gravitation and spectra). In the 20^{th}
century, the wavelength range accessible to telescopes greatly
increased (from high-energy \gamma-rays to long radio wavelengths), making
astronomy a /multi-wavelength/ science.

With the detection of neutrinos (first solar, then from SN1987A, and
most recently very high-energy neutrinos), astronomy became
"multi-messenger" (photons+neutrinos), a buzz word that is highly used
presently.

The addition of gravitational waves discussed today adds a completely
new way to look at astrophysical sources, probing optically thick and
thus inaccessible regions, and regimes where gravity is /strong/ (i.e.,
a full general relativistic treatment of the interaction of matter
with space-time becomes necessary).


* GW basics




** Indirect detection of GWs

  [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975ApJ...195L..51H/abstract][Hulse & Taylor 1975]] discovered the first pulsar (radio source
  repeating with very high precision interpreted physically as a
  neutron star rotating fast) in a binary system, PSR B1913+16 (a.k.a.
  "Hulse-Taylor pulsar"). They showed a radial velocity curve (recall
  [[./notes-lecture-BIN.org][the lecture on binary orbital motion]]) which demonstrated the orbit
  is eccentric and the companion is another compact object.

  Monitoring this system, and measuring the delay between periastron
  passage observed and the periastron passage predicted with a
  Keplerian orbit, one can see that the period is progressively
  speeding up, or, in other words, the orbit is shrinking in time.

  #+CAPTION: Dots are the measured cumulative time shift in periastron passage w.r.t. a Keplerian orbit with constant period for PSR B1913+16. The solid line is the prediction assuming the period is changing due to GW emission as predicted by general relativity. Note that this is *not* a fit!

  The measured agreement between the period decay of the Hulse-Taylor
  pulsar and general relativity prediction of the energy loss due to
  GW emission is considered the first /indirect/ evidence for GW (and
  was awarded the Nobel prize in 1993).


* Direct detection through interferometry

 - strain $h \ll 10^{-15} cm$ \sim size of nucleus
 - GW150914
 - increase rate of discovery

* The future of GW astronomy

 - LISA/TianQin
 - PTA
 - 3^{rd} Generation detectors (BBO/Einstein telescope)

* The problem: how do compact objects get so close to each other?


* Isolated binary evolution

* Dynamical channels
 - cluster
 - nuclear star cluster
 - AGN disk
 - connection to runaways?
