* Photons, neutrinos, and gravitational-wave astronomy

Astronomy since its inception lost in history is based on observations
of (visible) light from sources in the Sky. As mentioned in [[./notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.org][at the
beginning]], between the 17^{th} and 19^{th} century astronomy was unified
with physics (universal law of gravitation and interpretation of
spectra). In the 20^{th} century, the wavelength range accessible to
telescopes greatly increased (from high-energy \gamma-rays to long radio
wavelengths), making astronomy a /multi-wavelength/ science.

With the detection of neutrinos (first solar, then from SN1987A, and
most recently very high-energy neutrinos), astronomy became
"multi-messenger" (photons+neutrinos), a buzz word that is highly used
presently.

The addition of gravitational waves (GW) adds a completely new way to
study astrophysical sources, probing optically thick and thus
inaccessible regions, and regimes where gravity is /strong/ (i.e., a
full general relativistic treatment of the interaction of matter with
space-time becomes necessary).

Because the wavelength range for GWs (which are /not/ EM waves nor sound
waves!) accessible to presently available ground-base detectors such
as LIGO/Virgo/Kagra is in the 10-1000Hz range -- corresponding roughly
to the auditory range for typical human hears, it is often
metaphorically said that GWs allow us to "hear" the Universe. However,
this metafore is bound to become obsolete as multi-wavelength GW
observations become available (e.g., from "pulsar timing arrays" and
space-based GW observatories).

*Disclaimer:* to give a complete overview of GW physics we would need to
have a full course of general relativity (GR) first just as a start. I
will not attempt to be complete or exhaustive here, but just to give
some elements necessary to understand the astrophysical problem of the
formation of GW sources for ground and space-based detectors.

* GR and GW basics

General relativity is a /geometric/ theory of gravity that treats
space-time as /dynamical/ entity described by a tensor, the metric
$g_{\mu\nu}$. The dynamics of this entity is dictated by the distribution
of mass (or better energy density) within it, which determines the
curvature of space time. In turn, that curvature determines the
/geodesics/ that the energy density will follow in absence of other
(non-gravitational) forces.

This is formally described by Einstein's field equation:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EFE}
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = T_{\mu\nu} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the a priori unknown metric that acts as the
functional variable of this equation, $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy
tensor that describes the distribution of matter/energy that shapes
space-time (i.e., the source term which determines $g_{\mu\nu}$), and
$G_{\mu\nu}=R_{\mu\nu} - 0.5Rg_{\mu\nu}$ is Einstein's tensor ($R=R^{\mu}_{\mu}$ is
the trace of the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ which describes how different
from flat is the space-time described by $g_{\mu\nu}$ and it is a
function of $g_{\mu\nu}$ itself). The indexes $\mu$ and $\nu=0,1,2,3$
span the temporal and three spatial dimensions. Eq. \ref{eq:EFE} is
the one that describes simultaneously how matter (represented by the
stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$) "bends" space-time (represented by the
metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$) and viceversa how the structure of space-time
shapes the motion of matter along the geodesics defined by the
curvature of space-time (see any textbook on general relativity for
more information).

The fact that there is a finite speed $c$ for the propagation of
interaction fields (including space-time itself) allows for the
existence of /gravitational/ fields unbound from matter. An oscillating
unbound gravitational field is by definition a gravitational wave.

GWs, as any /wave/, are the solution of a linear perturbation on a
state. In the GW case, the state is the flat space-time metric
$g_{\mu\nu}$ describing space-time far away from any mass, and the
perturbation is often indicated with $h_{\mu\nu}$. Say that we know a
solution $g_{\mu\nu}$ (e.g., $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} = \mathrm{diag}(1, -1,
-1, -1)$ Minkowski's metric describing a flat space-time), we can
apply a small perturbation to it substituting $g_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow
g_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}$. Keeping only terms linear in $h_{\mu\nu}$ (which is
our new functional variable) we can rewrite Eq. \ref{eq:EFE} as:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GW_wave}
\left( \nabla^{2} - \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}\right) h_{\mu\nu} = -16\pi T_{\mu\nu} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which is a wave equation in three dimensions for $h_{\mu\nu}$ with speed
of propagation $c$, source term $T_{\mu\nu}$. In vacuum ($T_{\mu\nu}=0$),
and consequently $h_{\mu\nu}$ admits oscillating solutions $h_{\mu\nu} =
A_{\mu\nu}\exp(i k_{\alpha}x^{\alpha})$! These are the "ripple in space-time"
(i.e., in the metric tensor describing the properties of space-time in
general relativity) as GWs are often described.

** Sources of GWs

Before narrowing down what could be (mathematically and
astrophysically) the sources of GWs, let's consider when are GR
effects most relevant? A typical quantity to look at the so-called
"compactness" $M/R$ with $M$ mass of a source and $R$ its linear
dimension. Note that in natural units ($G=c=1$ typically used to
simplify the formalism in GR), this is a dimensionless number.

For low values of $M/R$, General Relativity reduces to Newtonian
gravity -- as it should being an extension of this theory, and in
Newtonian gravity the gravitational field is fixed and any change
propagates instantly: there are no gravitational waves.

*N.B.:* Just introducing the postulate that "gravity" has a finite speed
of propagation in Newtonian physics, one can build a lot of intuition
and quantitative results correct to order of magnitude for GW physics,
see [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984AmJPh..52..412S/abstract][Schutz 1984]] and  [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/andp.201600209][LVK Collaboration 2017]].

For general relativity effects to matter, $M/R$ needs to be "large":
either extremely large masses regardless of the scale (see the very
first ideas of what today we call a black hole from [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1784RSPT...74...35M/abstract][Michell 1784]] and
[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1799AllGE...4....1L/abstract][Laplace 1799]]), or for very dense matter limited to a very small linear
scale $R$. In the "stellar regime", we expect the densest stars, also
known collectively as "compact objects" to be involved, namely white
dwarfs (WD), neutron stars (NS), and black holes (BHs).

In general, the source term of GWs is going to be related to the term
describing the distribution in space-time of matter (the stress energy
tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$).

:Question:
- *Q*: what is the lowest order source term for electromagnetic
  radiation?
:end:

By analogy with electromagnetism (EM), let's consider the spatial
momenta of $T_{\mu\nu}$ assuming the mass distribution of the source to
be finite in extent, that is multiply by (possibly more than one
factor) $x^{\alpha}$ and integrate over the spatial volume. Like in EM,
the zeroth order momentum of a charge distribution is just the total
charge that is conserved, and that does not lead to EM radiation, the
same goes for GWs. In EM, the next order give the charge dipole, which
if it has a time-dependence creates EM radiation (e.g., Thompson
scattering). For gravity, the first order momentum of a mass
distribution, assuming the mass to be constant, has for
time-derivative the total momentum of the source. That is also
conserved: *there is no dipole radiation of GWs*. The next order is then
the quadrupole of the mass distribution: gravitational waves are
generated by the time-dependence of the quadrupole distribution of
mass at leading order.

One can obtain, at leading order, the so called quadrupole formula:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:quad}
h_{\mu\nu}(r) = \frac{2}{c^{4}}\frac{G}{r}\frac{d^{2} Q_{\mu\nu}}{d t^{2}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where $r$ is the luminosity distance and
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation} \label{eq:quadrupole_def}
Q_{\mu\nu} = \int d^{3} x T_{00}x_{\mu}x_{\nu} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
is the quadrupole of the mass distribution, with $T_{00}\equiv\rho$ the
mass density.

From Eq. \ref{eq:quad} we can see several important facts:
1. the amplitude of GWs scales with $1/r$, as opposed to $1/r^{2}$ for EM
   waves outside the near-field zone. This means that we can have
   detectable GWs from regions of the Universe that are too dim and
   far for EM observations.
2. the source need to have a non-zero second-time derivative of the
   quadrupole term of the mass distribution (at least): spherical
   objects, or objects moving in a straight line don't produce GWs.

In astrophysical context, what could be the sources? The most common
ones considered and searched for are *non-spherical compact stars* (for
example a spinning neutron star with a mountain not aligned to the
rotation axis), *binary systems made of neutron stars and/or black
holes*, and echoes of the Big Bang in GWs (this is a target for pulsar
timing arrays and beyond the scope of this course).



** Indirect detection of GWs

  [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975ApJ...195L..51H/abstract][Hulse & Taylor 1975]] discovered the first pulsar (radio source
  repeating with very high precision interpreted physically as a
  neutron star rotating fast) in a binary system, PSR B1913+16 (a.k.a.
  "Hulse-Taylor pulsar"). They showed a radial velocity curve (recall
  [[./notes-lecture-BIN.org][the lecture on binary orbital motion]]) which demonstrated the orbit
  is eccentric and the companion is another compact object.

  Monitoring this system, and measuring the delay between periastron
  passage observed and the periastron passage predicted with a
  Keplerian orbit, one can see that the period is progressively
  speeding up, or, in other words, the orbit is shrinking in time: the
  next periastron passage is earlier than predicted by a Keplerian
  orbit!

  #+CAPTION: Dots are the measured cumulative time shift in periastron passage w.r.t. a Keplerian orbit with constant period for PSR B1913+16. The solid line is the prediction assuming the period is changing due to GW emission as predicted by general relativity. Note that this is *not* a fit!

  The measured agreement between the period decay of the Hulse-Taylor
  pulsar and general relativity prediction of the energy loss due to
  GW emission is considered the first /indirect/ evidence for GW (and
  was awarded the Nobel prize in 1993).

** Minimum orbital separation for significant GW emission

Besides its historical importance, the "Hulse-Taylor pulsar" allows
to introduce an other important thing which requires GR to
demonstrate properly: what should the orbital separation of a binary
be for it to emit detectable GWs?

From Eq. \ref{eq:quad} and Eq. \ref{eq:quadrupole_def} one can see
that the answer should be also dependent on the masses of the binary
components.

For the Hulse-Taylor pulsar, we have:
 - $M_{1} = 1.441M_{\odot}$ for the mass of the detectable radio-pulsar
 - $M_{2} = 1.387M_{\odot}$ for the mass of the unseen object
 - $P=0.323$ days for the orbit
 - $e = 0.61$ for the orbit (likely a product of the [[file:notes-lecture-SNe.org::*Neutron star kicks][natal kick]] of the
   second-born NS)

Approximating the orbit as Keplerian (which we know is a mistake,
but the energy lost to GW in one orbit is fairly small and we are only
after one order of magnitude), we obtain $a\simeq2.8R_{\odot}$, which
corresponds to a periastron distance $a(1-e)\simeq 1.09R_{\odot}$ and apastron
distance $a(1+e)\simeq4.5R_{\odot}$.

For BHs, which are more massive than NS, we can afford larger orbital
separations, while less massive WDs require shorter separations/faster
orbital periods.

The take home point is that the compact objects (WD, NS or BH)
have to have separations $\le\mathrm{few} \times 10R_{\odot}$ to generate
significant amounts of GWs.

The amount of energy that goes in emitted GWs is a strong function of
the orbital separation $a$, the orbital eccentricity $e$, and the
masses of the systems in a binary: one can also ask what should the
separation be such that the timescale to shrink the orbital separation
to zero by GW emission (that is: how long it takes to obtain a
GW-driven inspiral and merger) is shorter than the age of the
Universe. Using the [[https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.136.B1224][Peters 1964]] formulae (which assume the compact
objects to be point-masses), one can again estimate that the
separation at the formation of the second compact object in a binary
needs to be below a few tens of $R_{\odot}$ to obtain GW-driven mergers
within the age of the Universe.

:Question:
- *Q*: How big do the stellar progenitors of these compact objects get
  during their evolution? How does that compare to the loose
  requirement we have derived above?
:end:

* Direct detection through interferometry

Although impressive, the observations of the Hulse-Taylor pulsar (and
other systems since then) only prove that the orbit of this binary NS
loses energy at a rate that matches impressively well predictions
based on assuming that the energy is lost to the emission of GWs.

From before the discovery of this system and for decades after, the
quest for a /direct/ detection continued -- with controversial claims
and rebuttals (see for example [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S057790731630572X][Chen et al. 2017]] for an historical
overview). Skipping ahead to the 21^{st} century, the first direct
detection came from ground-based interferometric observations
performed by the /Laser Interferometry gravitational observatory/ (LIGO)
laboratory -- after $\sim50$ years of continued effort.

On September 14^{th} 2015, the first direct detection of a binary BH
(BBH) merger, GW150914 occurred. And just two years later the first
binary NS (BNS) merger was detected in GW first (GW170817), and
through followup observations informed on the sky location by the GWs,
also in EM observations.

#+CAPTION: Detection of the first GW signal from the inspiral and merger of two BHs from [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvL.116f1102A/abstract][LVK collaboration 2016]]. Each column corresponds to a separate and independent detector (one in Washington and one in Louisiana): two are needed to make sure the signal is not a fluke, but appears in both at the same time modulo the light-travel time from one detector to the other. The top panels show the strain $h=\Delta L/L$, that is the relative change in size of the detector caused by the passage of the GW. Note the units! The second row show the prediction from numerical relativity calculations (i.e., the solutions of Eq. \ref{eq:EFE} obtained on a computer), the third row shows the residuals between the observation and the models in the second row. The third panel shows how the frequency of the signal changes in time, showing the characteristic "chirping" behavior (as time passes, the signal increases in frequency and becomes louder). Note also that we observe the final half-second of the life ot the system (how long the signal is within the detector band depends also on the masses involved, it is up to \sim10 seconds for a BNS)

This was such a long process because this detection really pushed the
limits of technological capabilities. Without entering in the details
of the detection strategy, a successful detection requires to measure
a change in position of mirrors bouncing laser light of $\sim10^{-21}$ cm
(over $\ge4$ km size of the detectors), as shown in the figure above:
*this is 1/1000 of the characteristic size of a nucleus*!

Today, we know of $\sim100$ BBH mergers, still only one BNS merger, and
we have a few BH-NS mergers (but unfortunately all too far for the
detection of EM counterparts): we already know more stellar-mass BH
from GWs than any other EM signature!
