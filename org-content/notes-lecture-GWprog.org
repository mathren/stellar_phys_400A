* Photons, neutrinos, and gravitational-wave astronomy

Astronomy since its inception lost in history is based on observations
of (visible) light from sources in the Sky. As mentioned in [[./notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.org][at the
beginning]], between the 17^{th} and 19^{th} century astronomy was unified
with physics (universal law of gravitation and interpretation of
spectra). In the 20^{th} century, the wavelength range accessible to
telescopes greatly increased (from high-energy \gamma-rays to long radio
wavelengths), making astronomy a /multi-wavelength/ science.

With the detection of neutrinos (first solar, then from SN1987A, and
most recently very high-energy neutrinos), astronomy became
"multi-messenger" (photons+neutrinos), a buzz word that is highly used
presently.

The addition of gravitational waves (GW) adds a completely new way to
study astrophysical sources, probing optically thick and thus
inaccessible regions, and regimes where gravity is /strong/ (i.e., a
full general relativistic treatment of the interaction of matter with
space-time becomes necessary).

Because the wavelength range for GWs (which are /not/ EM waves nor sound
waves!) accessible to presently available ground-base detectors such
as LIGO/Virgo/Kagra is in the 10-1000Hz range -- corresponding roughly
to the auditory range for typical human hears, it is often
metaphorically said that GWs allow us to "hear" the Universe. However,
this metafore is bound to become obsolete as multi-wavelength GW
observations become available (e.g., from "pulsar timing arrays" and
space-based GW observatories).

*Disclaimer:* to give a complete overview of GW physics we would need to
have a full course of general relativity (GR) first just as a start. I
will not attempt to be complete or exhaustive here, but just to give
some elements necessary to understand the astrophysical problem of the
formation of GW sources for ground and space-based detectors.

* GR and GW basics

General relativity is a /geometric/ theory of gravity that treats
space-time as /dynamical/ entity described by a tensor, the metric
$g_{\mu\nu}$. The dynamics of this entity is dictated by the distribution
of mass (or better energy density) within it, which determines the
curvature of space time. In turn, that curvature determines the
/geodesics/ that the energy density will follow in absence of other
(non-gravitational) forces.

This is formally described by Einstein's field equation:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EFE}
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = T_{\mu\nu} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the a priori unknown metric that acts as the
functional variable of this equation, $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy
tensor that describes the distribution of matter/energy that shapes
space-time (i.e., the source term which determines $g_{\mu\nu}$), and
$G_{\mu\nu}=R_{\mu\nu} - 0.5Rg_{\mu\nu}$ is Einstein's tensor ($R=R^{\mu}_{\mu}$ is
the trace of the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ which describes how different
from flat is the space-time described by $g_{\mu\nu}$ and it is a
function of $g_{\mu\nu}$ itself). The indexes $\mu$ and $\nu=0,1,2,3$
span the temporal and three spatial dimensions. Eq. \ref{eq:EFE} is
the one that describes simultaneously how matter (represented by the
stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$) "bends" space-time (represented by the
metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$) and viceversa how the structure of space-time
shapes the motion of matter along the geodesics defined by the
curvature of space-time (see any textbook on general relativity for
more information).

The fact that there is a finite speed $c$ for the propagation of
interaction fields (including space-time itself) allows for the
existence of /gravitational/ fields unbound from matter. An oscillating
unbound gravitational field is by definition a gravitational wave.

GWs, as any /wave/, are the solution of a linear perturbation on a
state. In the GW case, the state is the flat space-time metric
$g_{\mu\nu}$ describing space-time far away from any mass, and the
perturbation is often indicated with $h_{\mu\nu}$. Say that we know a
solution $g_{\mu\nu}$ (e.g., $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} = \mathrm{diag}(1, -1,
-1, -1)$ Minkowski's metric describing a flat space-time), we can
apply a small perturbation to it: $g_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow g_{\mu\nu} +
h_{\mu\nu}$. Keeping only terms linear in $h_{\mu\nu}$ (which is our new
functional variable) we can rewrite Eq. \ref{eq:EFE} as:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GW_wave}
\left( \nabla^{2} - \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}\right) h_{\mu\nu} = -16\pi T_{\mu\nu} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which is a wave equation in three dimensions for $h_{\mu\nu}$ with speed
of propagation $c$, source term $T_{\mu\nu}$. In vacuum ($T_{\mu\nu}=0$),
and consequently $h_{\mu\nu}$ admits oscillating solutions $h_{\mu\nu} =
A_{\mu\nu}\exp(i k_{\alpha}x^{\alpha})$! These are the "ripple in space-time"
(i.e., in the metric tensor describing the properties of space-time in
general relativity) as GWs are often described.

** Sources of GWs

Before narrowing down what could be (mathematically and
astrophysically) the sources of GWs, let's consider when are General
relativity effects most relevant? A typical quantity to look at the
the so-called "compactness" $M/R$ with $M$ mass of a source and $R$
its linear dimension. Note that in natural units ($G=c=1$), this is a
dimensionless number.

For low values of $M/R$, General Relativity reduces to Newtonian
gravity, and in Newtonian gravity the gravitational field is fixed and
any change propagates instantly: there are no gravitational waves. For
general relativity effects to matter, $M/R$ needs to be large: either
extremely large masses regardless of the scale (see the very first
ideas of what today we call a black hole from Mitchell and Laplace),
or for very dense matter. In the "stellar regime", we expect the
densest stars, also known collectively as "compact objects" to be
involved, namely white dwarfs (WD), neutron stars (NS), and black
holes (BHs).

:Question:
- *Q*: what is the lowest order source term for electromagnetic
  radiation?
:end:

In general, the source term of GWs is going to be related to the term
describing the distribution in space-time of matter (the stress energy
tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$).

By analogy with electromagnetism (EM), let's consider the spatial
momenta of $T_{\mu\nu}$ assuming the mass distribution of the source to
be finite in extent, that is multiply by (possibly more than one
factor) $x^{\alpha}$ and integrate over the spatial volume. Like in EM
the zeroth order momentum of a charge distribution is just the total
charge that is conserved, and that does not lead to EM radiation, the
same goes for GWs. In EM, the next order give the charge dipole, which
if it has a time-dependence creates EM radiation. For gravity, the
first order momentum of a mass distribution, assuming the mass to be
constant, has for time-derivative the total momentum of the source.
That is also conserved: *there is no dipole radiation of GWs*.
The next order is then the quadrupole of the mass distribution:
gravitational waves are generated by the time-dependence of the
quadrupole distribution of mass at leading order.

One can obtain, at leading order, the so called quadrupole formula:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:quad}
h_{\mu\nu}(r) = \frac{2}{c^{4}}\frac{G}{r}\frac{d^{2} Q_{\mu\nu}}{d t^{2}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where $r$ is the luminosity distance and
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
Q_{\mu\nu} = \int d^{3} x \rho(\mathbf{x})\left(x_{\mu}x_{\nu}-\frac{1}{3}r^{2}\delta_{\mu\nu}\right) \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
is the quadrupole of the mass distribution.

From Eq. \ref{eq:quad} we can see several important facts:
1. the amplitude of GWs scales with $1/r$, as opposed to $1/r^{2}$ for EM
   waves outside the radiation zone. This means that we can have GWs
   detectable from regions of the Universe that are too dim and far
   for EM observations.
2. the source need to have a non-zero second-time derivative of the
   quadrupole term of the mass distribution (at least): spherical
   objects, or objects moving in a straight line don't produce GWs.

In astrophysical context, what could be the sources? The most common
ones considered and searched for are *non-spherical compact stars* (for
example a spinning neutron star with a mountain not aligned to the
rotation axis), *binary systems made of neutron stars and/or black
holes*, and echoes of the Big Bang in GWs (this is a target for pulsar
timing arrays and beyond the scope of this course).



** Indirect detection of GWs

  [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975ApJ...195L..51H/abstract][Hulse & Taylor 1975]] discovered the first pulsar (radio source
  repeating with very high precision interpreted physically as a
  neutron star rotating fast) in a binary system, PSR B1913+16 (a.k.a.
  "Hulse-Taylor pulsar"). They showed a radial velocity curve (recall
  [[./notes-lecture-BIN.org][the lecture on binary orbital motion]]) which demonstrated the orbit
  is eccentric and the companion is another compact object.

  Monitoring this system, and measuring the delay between periastron
  passage observed and the periastron passage predicted with a
  Keplerian orbit, one can see that the period is progressively
  speeding up, or, in other words, the orbit is shrinking in time.

  #+CAPTION: Dots are the measured cumulative time shift in periastron passage w.r.t. a Keplerian orbit with constant period for PSR B1913+16. The solid line is the prediction assuming the period is changing due to GW emission as predicted by general relativity. Note that this is *not* a fit!

  The measured agreement between the period decay of the Hulse-Taylor
  pulsar and general relativity prediction of the energy loss due to
  GW emission is considered the first /indirect/ evidence for GW (and
  was awarded the Nobel prize in 1993).
