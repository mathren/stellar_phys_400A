* Photons, neutrinos, and gravitational-wave astronomy

Astronomy since its inception lost in history is based on observations
of (visible) light from sources in the Sky. As mentioned in [[./notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.org][at the
beginning]], between the 17^{th} and 19^{th} century astronomy was unified
with physics (universal law of gravitation and interpretation of
spectra). In the 20^{th} century, the wavelength range accessible to
telescopes greatly increased (from high-energy \gamma-rays to long radio
wavelengths), making astronomy a /multi-wavelength/ science.

With the detection of neutrinos (first solar, then from SN1987A, and
most recently very high-energy neutrinos), astronomy became
"multi-messenger" (photons+neutrinos), a buzz word that is highly used
presently.

The addition of gravitational waves (GW) adds a completely new way to
study astrophysical sources, probing optically thick and thus
inaccessible regions, and regimes where gravity is /strong/ (i.e., a
full general relativistic treatment of the interaction of matter with
space-time becomes necessary).

Because the wavelength range for GWs (which are /not/ EM waves nor sound
waves!) accessible to presently available ground-base detectors such
as LIGO/Virgo/Kagra is in the 10-1000Hz range -- corresponding roughly
to the auditory range for typical human hears, it is often
metaphorically said that GWs allow us to "hear" the Universe. However,
this metafore is bound to become obsolete as multi-wavelength GW
observations become available (e.g., from "pulsar timing arrays" and
space-based GW observatories).

*Disclaimer:* to give a complete overview of GW physics we would need to
have a full course of general relativity (GR) first just as a start. I
will not attempt to be complete or exhaustive here, but just to give
some elements necessary to understand the astrophysical problem of the
formation of GW sources for ground and space-based detectors.

* GR and GW basics

General relativity is a /geometric/ theory of gravity that treats
space-time as /dynamical/ entity described by a tensor, the metric
$g_{\mu\nu}$. The dynamics of this entity is dictated by the distribution
of mass (or better energy density) within it, which determines the
curvature of space time. In turn, that curvature determines the
/geodesics/ that the energy density will follow in absence of other
(non-gravitational) forces.

This is formally described by Einstein's field equation:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EFE}
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = T_{\mu\nu} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the a priori unknown metric that acts as the
functional variable of this equation, $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy
tensor that describes the distribution of matter/energy that shapes
space-time (i.e., the source term which determines $g_{\mu\nu}$), and
$G_{\mu\nu}=R_{\mu\nu} - 0.5Rg_{\mu\nu}$ is Einstein's tensor ($R=R^{\mu}_{\mu}$ is
the trace of the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ which describes how different
from flat is the space-time described by $g_{\mu\nu}$ and it is a
function of $g_{\mu\nu}$ itself). The indexes $\mu$ and $\nu=0,1,2,3$
span the temporal and three spatial dimensions. Eq. \ref{eq:EFE} is
the one that describes simultaneously how matter (represented by the
stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$) "bends" space-time (represented by the
metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$) and viceversa how the structure of space-time
shapes the motion of matter along the geodesics defined by the
curvature of space-time (see any textbook on general relativity for
more information).

The fact that there is a finite speed $c$ for the propagation of
interaction fields (including space-time itself) allows for the
existence of /gravitational/ fields unbound from matter. An oscillating
unbound gravitational field is by definition a gravitational wave.

GWs, as any /wave/, are the solution of a linear perturbation on a
state. In the GW case, the state is the flat space-time metric
$g_{\mu\nu}$ describing space-time far away from any mass, and the
perturbation is often indicated with $h_{\mu\nu}$. Say that we know a
solution $g_{\mu\nu}$ (e.g., $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} = \mathrm{diag}(1, -1,
-1, -1)$ Minkowski's metric describing a flat space-time), we can
apply a small perturbation to it substituting $g_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow
g_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}$. Keeping only terms linear in $h_{\mu\nu}$ (which is
our new functional variable) we can rewrite Eq. \ref{eq:EFE} as:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GW_wave}
\left( \nabla^{2} - \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}\right) h_{\mu\nu} \propto T_{\mu\nu} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which is a wave equation in three dimensions for $h_{\mu\nu}$ with speed
of propagation $c$, source term proportional to $T_{\mu\nu}$. In vacuum
($T_{\mu\nu}=0$), and consequently $h_{\mu\nu}$ admits oscillating solutions
$h_{\mu\nu} = A_{\mu\nu}\exp(i k_{\alpha}x^{\alpha})$! These are the "ripple in
space-time" (i.e., in the metric tensor describing the properties of
space-time in general relativity) as GWs are often described.

** Sources of GWs

Before narrowing down what could be (mathematically and
astrophysically) the sources of GWs, let's consider when are GR
effects most relevant? A typical quantity to look at the so-called
"compactness" $M/R$ with $M$ mass of a source and $R$ its linear
dimension. Note that in natural units ($G=c=1$ typically used to
simplify the formalism in GR), this is a dimensionless number.

For low values of $M/R$, General Relativity reduces to Newtonian
gravity -- as it should being an extension of this theory, and in
Newtonian gravity the gravitational field is fixed and any change
propagates instantly: there are no gravitational waves.

*N.B.:* Just introducing the postulate that "gravity" has a finite speed
of propagation in Newtonian physics, one can build a lot of intuition
and quantitative results correct to order of magnitude for GW physics,
see [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984AmJPh..52..412S/abstract][Schutz 1984]] and  [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/andp.201600209][LVK Collaboration 2017]].

For general relativity effects to matter, $M/R$ needs to be "large":
either extremely large masses regardless of the scale (see the very
first ideas of what today we call a black hole from [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1784RSPT...74...35M/abstract][Michell 1784]] and
[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1799AllGE...4....1L/abstract][Laplace 1799]]), or for very dense matter limited to a very small linear
scale $R$. In the "stellar regime", we expect the densest stars, also
known collectively as "compact objects" to be involved, namely white
dwarfs (WD), neutron stars (NS), and black holes (BHs).

In general, the source term of GWs is going to be related to the term
describing the distribution in space-time of matter (the stress energy
tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$).

:Question:
- *Q*: what is the lowest order source term for electromagnetic
  radiation?
:end:

By analogy with electromagnetism (EM), let's consider the spatial
momenta of $T_{\mu\nu}$ assuming the mass distribution of the source to
be finite in extent, that is multiply by (possibly more than one
factor) $x^{\alpha}$ and integrate over the spatial volume. Like in EM,
the zeroth order momentum of a charge distribution is just the total
charge that is conserved, and that does not lead to EM radiation, the
same goes for GWs. In EM, the next order give the charge dipole, which
if it has a time-dependence creates EM radiation (e.g., Thompson
scattering). For gravity, the first order momentum of a mass
distribution, assuming the mass to be constant, has for
time-derivative the total momentum of the source. That is also
conserved: *there is no dipole radiation of GWs*. The next order is then
the quadrupole of the mass distribution: gravitational waves are
generated by the time-dependence of the quadrupole distribution of
mass at leading order.

One can obtain, at leading order, the so called quadrupole formula:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:quad}
h_{\mu\nu}(r) = \frac{2}{c^{4}}\frac{G}{r}\frac{d^{2} Q_{\mu\nu}}{d t^{2}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where $r$ is the luminosity distance and
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation} \label{eq:quadrupole_def}
Q_{\mu\nu} = \int d^{3} x T_{00}x_{\mu}x_{\nu} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
is the quadrupole of the mass distribution, with $T_{00}\equiv\rho$ the
mass density.

From Eq. \ref{eq:quad} we can see several important facts:
1. the amplitude of GWs scales with $1/r$, as opposed to $1/r^{2}$ for EM
   waves outside the near-field zone. This means that we can have
   detectable GWs from regions of the Universe that are too dim and
   far for EM observations.
2. the source need to have a non-zero second-time derivative of the
   quadrupole term of the mass distribution (at least): spherical
   objects, or objects moving in a straight line don't produce GWs.

In astrophysical context, what could be the sources? The most common
ones considered and searched for are *non-spherical rotating compact
objects* (for example a spinning neutron star with a mountain not
aligned to the rotation axis would produce a GW with constant
frequency equal to the rotation frequency of the source), *binary
systems made of compact objects* (which would lose energy to GWs and
progressively shrink the orbit until a final merger of the two compact
objects) and echoes of the Big Bang in GWs (this is a target for
pulsar timing arrays and beyond the scope of this course).

** Indirect detection of GWs

  [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975ApJ...195L..51H/abstract][Hulse & Taylor 1975]] discovered the first pulsar (radio source
  repeating with very high precision interpreted physically as a
  neutron star rotating fast) in a binary system, PSR B1913+16 (a.k.a.
  "Hulse-Taylor pulsar"). They showed a radial velocity curve (recall
  [[./notes-lecture-BIN.org][the lecture on binary orbital motion]]) which demonstrated the orbit
  is eccentric and the companion is another compact object.

  Monitoring this system, and measuring the delay between periastron
  passage observed and the periastron passage predicted with a
  Keplerian orbit, one can see that the period is progressively
  speeding up, or, in other words, the orbit is shrinking in time: the
  next periastron passage is earlier than predicted by a Keplerian
  orbit!

  #+CAPTION: Dots are the measured cumulative time shift in periastron passage w.r.t. a Keplerian orbit with constant period for PSR B1913+16. The solid line is the prediction assuming the period is changing due to GW emission as predicted by general relativity. Note that this is *not* a fit!

  The measured agreement between the period decay of the Hulse-Taylor
  pulsar and general relativity prediction of the energy loss due to
  GW emission is considered the first /indirect/ evidence for GW (and
  [[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1993/summary/][was awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1993]]).

** Minimum orbital separation for significant GW emission

Besides its historical importance, the "Hulse-Taylor pulsar" allows
to introduce an other important thing which requires GR to
demonstrate properly: what should the orbital separation of a binary
be for it to emit detectable GWs?

From Eq. \ref{eq:quad} and Eq. \ref{eq:quadrupole_def} one can see
that the answer should be also dependent on the masses of the binary
components.

For the Hulse-Taylor pulsar, we have:
 - $M_{1} = 1.441M_{\odot}$ for the mass of the detectable radio-pulsar
 - $M_{2} = 1.387M_{\odot}$ for the mass of the unseen object
 - $P=0.323$ days for the orbit
 - $e = 0.61$ for the orbit (likely a product of the [[file:notes-lecture-SNe.org::*Neutron star kicks][natal kick]] of the
   second-born NS)

Approximating the orbit as Keplerian (which we know is a mistake,
but the energy lost to GW in one orbit is fairly small and we are only
after one order of magnitude), we obtain $a\simeq2.8R_{\odot}$, which
corresponds to a periastron distance $a(1-e)\simeq 1.09R_{\odot}$ and apastron
distance $a(1+e)\simeq4.5R_{\odot}$.

For BHs, which are more massive than NS, we can afford larger orbital
separations, while less massive WDs require shorter separations/faster
orbital periods.

The take home point is that the compact objects (WD, NS or BH)
have to have separations $\le\mathrm{few} \times 10R_{\odot}$ to generate
significant amounts of GWs.

The amount of energy that goes in emitted GWs is a strong function of
the orbital separation $a$, the orbital eccentricity $e$, and the
masses of the systems in a binary: one can also ask what should the
separation be such that the timescale to shrink the orbital separation
to zero by GW emission (that is: how long it takes to obtain a
GW-driven inspiral and merger) is shorter than the age of the
Universe. Using the [[https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.136.B1224][Peters 1964]] formulae (which assume the compact
objects to be point-masses), one can again estimate that the
separation at the formation of the second compact object in a binary
needs to be below a few tens of $R_{\odot}$ to obtain GW-driven mergers
within the age of the Universe.

:Question:
- *Q*: How big do the stellar progenitors of these compact objects get
  during their evolution? How does that compare to the loose
  requirement we have derived above?
:end:

* Direct detection

Although impressive, the observations of the Hulse-Taylor pulsar (and
other systems since then, see for example Table 3 in [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...829...55W/abstract][Weisberg & Huang
2016]]) only prove that the orbit of this binary NS loses energy at a
rate that matches impressively well predictions based on assuming that
the energy is lost to the emission of GWs.

From before the discovery of this system and for decades after, the
quest for a /direct/ detection continued -- with controversial claims
and rebuttals (see for example [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S057790731630572X][Chen et al. 2017]] for an historical
overview). Skipping ahead to the 21^{st} century, the first direct
detection came from ground-based interferometric observations
performed by the /Laser Interferometry gravitational observatory/ (LIGO)
laboratory -- after $\sim50$ years of continued effort.

On September 14^{th} 2015, the first direct detection of a binary BH
(BBH) merger, GW150914 occurred. And just two years later the first
binary NS (BNS) merger was detected in GW first (GW170817), and
through followup observations informed on the sky location by the GWs,
also in EM observations.

#+CAPTION: Detection of the first GW signal from the inspiral and merger of two BHs from [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvL.116f1102A/abstract][LVK collaboration 2016]]. Each column corresponds to a separate and independent detector (one in Washington and one in Louisiana): two are needed to make sure the signal is not a fluke, but appears in both at the same time modulo the light-travel time from one detector to the other. The top panels show the strain $h=\Delta L/L$, that is the relative change in size of the detector caused by the passage of the GW. Note the scale! For LIGO $L\simeq4$ km, corresponding to $\Delta L\sim 10^{-16}$ cm, smaller than a nucleus! The second row show the prediction from numerical relativity calculations (i.e., the solutions of Eq. \ref{eq:EFE} obtained on a computer), the third row shows the residuals between the observation and the models in the second row. The third panel shows how the frequency of the signal changes in time, showing the characteristic "chirping" behavior (as time passes, the signal increases in frequency and becomes louder). Note also that we observe the final half-second of the life ot the system (how long the signal is within the detector band depends also on the masses involved, it is up to \sim10 seconds for a BNS)

[[./images/GW150914.png]]


This was such a long process because this detection really pushed the
limits of technological capabilities. Without entering in the details
of the detection strategy, a successful detection requires to measure
a change in position of mirrors bouncing laser light of $\le10^{-16}$ cm
(over $\ge4$ km size of the detectors), as shown in the figure above:
*this is $\le1/10$ of the characteristic size of a nucleus*!

Today, while observations continue, we know of $\sim100$ BBH mergers, a
couple of BNS merger, and we have a few BH-NS mergers (but
unfortunately all BNS except GW170817 and all BH-NS mergers have been
too far for the detection of EM counterparts): we already know more
stellar-mass BH from GWs than any other EM signature!

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/GWTC-3_stellar-graveyard.jpg]]

Thanks to the direct detections of GWs we now know several
astrophysical facts that had been hypothesized before, but were
lacking empirical confirmation:
- BBH exist!
- stellar mass BHs with masses $\gg 10M_{\odot}$ exist!
- BH-NS binary exist!
- we have some constrain on the rate at which these form with a
  "final" (from the stellar evolution point of view)/"initial" (from
  the GW-driven inspiral point of view) separation sufficient to merge
  within the age of the Universe

*N.B.:* GWs also offer cosmological facts, e.g., the non-detection (as
of yet) of a stochastic background, unique constraints on GR in strong
gravity (e.g., from the "ring-down" phase just after the merger, when
the new formed BH "shakes away its hairs"), and nuclear physics
(GW170817 confirmed that BNS mergers are one site for [[file:notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org::*Reactions involving neutrons][r-process]]
nucleosynthesis and formation of element heavier than Iron).
Ultimately, GW astronomy is a completely new way to explore the
Universe. The discussion here is far from complete and focused on the
aspects related to stellar physics only.

* The problem: how do compact objects get so close to each other?

- two classes: isolated systems (binary/triples/quadruples) and
  dynamical systems (globular clusters, nuclear star clusters) and
  exotic channels (AGN gas-assisted inspirals, multiple compact
  objects from a single star)

** Isolated evolution channels

#+CAPTION: Cartoon of the various steps in the evolution of a massive binary system evolving to be a GW-driven BNS merger, from [[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa7e89][Tauris et al. 2017]]. Many qualitative variations (e.g., NS \leftrightarrow BH, SN explosion \leftrightarrow failed explosion, RLOF \leftrightarrow Common envelope) have been proposed to explain BNS and BBH with various properties, see also review by [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ARA%26A..62...21M/abstract][Marchant & Bodensteiner 2024]].
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/Tauris17.png]]


** Dynamical channels

Alternatively, another way to solve the issue of two compact objects
needing to be closer than their parent stars are large to get
GW-driven mergers within the age of the Universe is to leverage
dynamical N-body interactions.

The core of the idea is that stars could evolve in isolation (or in
binaries that might interact, but not necessarily in the way leading
to a GW progenitor), and be put together by their (Newtonian)
gravitational interaction in a dense stellar system.

*N.B.:* Binaries are still important! Since the cross section for N body
interactions scales with some power of the stellar radius for single
stars, and with the orbital separation for a binary ($\sigma \propto a^{2} \gg R^{2})
it is much more likely to have a significant gravitational interaction
between a binary and a star (or between two binaries) than between two
single stars.


The video (from Prof. Carl Rodriguez) below shows a "zoom in" on one
of the many N-body interactions that can happen. There is one incoming
binary (in orange) that interacts (chaotically) through purely
Newtonian gravity with a single star (in cyan). At the end of the
interaction one of the initial binary members (statistically the least
massive) finds itself alone and shot out at a high velocity, and the
new binary has a shorter separation (the kinetic energy of the ejected
star comes from the orbital energy of the original binary). This
example thus shows that the simplest 3 body system results in the
ejection of a "runaway star" and a tighter binary. Iterating this
multiple times in a dense stellar system can lead to stellar or
compact object binaries tight enough to emit significant amount of GWs
and merge within the age of the Universe.

#  [[./images/nopn_dvd.mp4]]

Multiple dense stellar environment have been proposed:
 - stellar clusters: if sufficiently dense they can produce large
   rates of BBH (while they don't work well for systems involving NS
   that get a kick at birth and whose progenitors are less massive and
   live in the cluster outskirts preventing them from entering the
   most dense part of the cluster where most interactions occur)
 - nuclear star cluster: these are clusters around the supermassive BH
   at the center of a galaxy. This makes the escape velocity from
   these higher, and increases the chances of retaining the merger
   products and get multiple "generations" of mergers
 - Active Galactic Nucleus disk: in the accretion disk of the
   supermassive BH in the center of a galaxy there can be stars and
   compact objects. They can interact dynamically (possibly with the
   gas of the disk playing an important role), and this has been
   proposed as a possible site for GW mergers.
 - (Newtonian) Gravitational dynamics in triples and quadruple systems
   are in a sense a "transition" class between dynamical and isolated
   evolution channels.


*N.B.:* This brief overview is far from complete: this is a relatively
new and extremely active field, and by the time I finish writing any
comprehensive summary there would be much more to summarize already!

* The future of GW astronomy

#+CAPTION: Sensitivity curves of present and planned GW detectors: Ground based detectors are on the right (highest frequencies), space-based in the middle, and galaxy-size pulsar-timing based on the left.

** Ground-based detectors

[[./images/GW_timeline.png]]


The current rate of GW detection within the frequency range of LIGO,
VIRGO, KAGRA is very high, and by the end-of-life of these
most-precise machines ever built, we expect to have a sizeable
population of GW-driven mergers of compact objects.

Future plans for so-called 3^{rd} generation GW detectors (the 2^{nd}
generation are the space-based detectors discussed below) are being
discussed. These will likely be interferometers with much longer arms
($L\simeq 4$ km \rightarrow $L\simeq 40$ km) and buried underground to limit the
high-frequency noise from micro-earthquakes. Multiple competing plans
exist at this point (e.g., Cosmic Explorer in the US and Einstein
Telescope in Europe), and are expected to be able to detect BBH merger
up to redshift \sim20, much before the formation of the first stars!
