* Pre-main sequence and Hayashi track
We have developed a set of 4 non-linear, coupled ODEs to describe the
/structure/ and /evolution/ of stars (with physical approximations
built-in), with an EOS for closure conditions plus a set of equations
that describe the changes in composition due to nuclear processing and
mixing (see for example [[./notes-lecture-neutrinos.org::*Summary of equations we have derived][this summary]]).

We have also worked out the ordering of timescales of the problem:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\tau_\mathrm{nuc} \gg \tau_\mathrm{KH} \gg \tau_\mathrm{free\ fall} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which implies that for a star in hydrostatic equilibrium and LTE at
every location throughout the star (i.e., global gravothermal
equilibrium), the equations describing the (slow) /evolution/ of the
composition decouple from the 4 ODEs+EOS that describe the /structure/ of
the star.

The =MESA_web= stellar models that you have been looking at start at the
/top right/ of the Herzsprung-Russell diagram (so high L low T_{eff}) as a
uniform sphere of gas with set composition that is in hydrostatic but
not thermal equilibrium. These models thus evolve on a thermal
timescale \sim\tau_{KH} losing energy (L goes down) and contracting -- picture
lines of constant R=(L/(4\pi\sigma T_{eff}^{4)}))^{1/2}! This /is/ the gravothermal KH
contraction which leads to the increase in average \langle T \rangle by the virial
theorem, and it goes on until either:
1. *degeneracy pressure stops this process by changing the EOS, tapping
   into quantum mechanical effects to provide extra pressure*: this
   should not happen to any of your models, but it is how you form a
   *Brown Dwarfs* (BD) and a planets. The distinction between these is
   whether some minor nuclear burning, energetically unimportant but
   still affecting the composition happens before the object sets on
   gravothermal equilibrium: BD experience deuterium burning, but
   deuterium is a loosely bound nucleus and its burning doesn't release
   a lot of energy.
2. *an energy source (namely nuclear burning) stops the collapse*. This
   is what happens to your stars, where H burning (as the lightest and
   most energy-releasing fuel) starts. The point where L=L_{nuc} because
   of H core burning is referred to as *Zero Age Main Sequence* (ZAMS),
   since the "main sequence" of the color magnitude diagram containing
   most stars is made of stars during their longest phase of evolution,
   hydrogen core burning.

From the ignition of H in the core onwards, for timescales \tau \ll \tau_{nuc},
once the composition is decided (i.e., for fixed mass fractions {X_{i}})
the structure is determined by those 4 ODEs+EOS. This means that the
/initial/ structure of the star is /not/ sensitive to the (complex,
not-yet-fully understood) star formation process, and the ZAMS
structure is fully determined by the composition!

** Pre-main sequence stellar structure

If the gravothermal collapse of the mass of gas considered ends with
the ignition of nuclear fuel (option 2. above), that is, if we make a
star (recall \langle T \rangle \prop \mu M/R, so the mass determines whether we get
here), then the phase from the beginning of the simulation until ZAMS
is called /pre-main-sequence/ (pre-MS).

During this phase the models start from the top-right of the diagram
at high L, large R (\Rightarrow low \langle T \rangle), and progressively contract and heat
up. This is an idealization: often as stars are doing that, they still
accrete mass, in the most massive stars (which have shorter KH
timescales and pre-MS phases), accretion may not be over until even
after ZAMS! See for instance the recent review by [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ASPC..534..275O/abstract][Offner et al. 2023]].

The \langle T \rangle is initially low (the gas that is collapsing is coming from
the ISM), and increasing. Since \nabla = \partial ln(T)/\partial ln(P) \propto \kappa L and \kappa
generally increases at low T, initially the stars have steep
temperature gradient and are /fully convective/! This homogenizes their
composition (but deuterium burning during the pre-MS can change this),
and also determines that \nabla\simeq\nabla_{ad} to very good approximation.

Since almost arbitrarily high energy flux can be carried by
(efficient) convection maintaining an adiabatic gradient, this means
the luminosity of a fully convective star does not depend much on its
structure (unlike a stably stratified /radiative/ star where the
temperature gradient of the /structure/ is determined by the need of
carrying the flux out).

This leads to the evolution of these stars along an almost vertical
initial path on the HR diagram, the so-called /Hayashi track/ (see also
Sec. 9.1.1. of Onno Pols' lecture notes for an analytic
approximation). The Hayashi track corresponds to solutions for fully
convective stars. Wiggles around this vertical line are due to
recombination and partial ionization zones leading to deviations of
the temperature gradient \nabla from adiabatic.

The Hayashi line effectively determines a right, low-T_{eff} boundary on
the HRD for stars in hydrostatic equilibrium: if a star were to be
colder, it would have a steeper-than-adiabatic gradient somewhere and
a lower opacity \kappa, thus radiation would escape more easily, meaning L
would increase, moving the star upwards back onto the Hayashi track.

*N.B.:* for these cool temperatures, we already know that the opacity is
dominated by H^{-}, molecules, and dust, and we have approximate powerlaw
scalings with T_{eff} (cf. [[./notes-lecture-kappa.org][opacity lecture]] and references therein).

The location in T_{eff} of the Hayashi track is dependent on the mass M
of the star: more massive stars are hotter since the very beginning.
This can be analytically derived imposing \nabla=\nabla_{ad} and solving the
remaining 3 EOSs assuming some form for \kappa\equiv\kappa(T,\rho) at the photosphere:
effectively the outer boundary condition and atmospheric physics
determine this.

Stars to the right, hotter side of the Hayashi track instead must not
be /fully convective/ and have some radiative layers.

* Main sequence

As the gravothermal collapse continues and \langle T \rangle increases, at some
point, if we are making a star, by /definition/ nuclear burning turns on
(option 2. above). This is when the central temperature (which at this
stage is the highest temperature in the star), is sufficient to obtain
enough tunneling through the Coulomb barriers.

Because it is abundant, and its burning releases a lot of energy per
nucleon (\sim 6.5MeV/nucleon) because it produces the double-magic
nucleus $^{4}\mathrm{He} \equiv \alpha$ (neutrons /and/ protons fill their nuclear "shells",
by analogy with electron shells in atomic physics), hydrogen is the
first fuel to ignite.

** Structure during the main sequence
As we discussed in the [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-cycles.org][nuclear reaction cycles lecture]], hydrogen
burning can occur in two different ways: pp-cycle and CN-NO bi-cycle.

Looking at =MESA-web= models, we can see that the pp-cycle is sufficient
to achieve the equilibrium condition L_{nuc}=\int dm \varepsilon_{nuc}
\equiv L in low mass stars (*N.B.:* L\prop M^{x} with x>1). This is because the
pp-cycle has lower Coulomb barriers (shallower relation between \varepsilon_{nuc}
and T) but a higher normalization (cf. [[file:notes-lecture-nuclear-cycles.org::*pp \rightarrow CNO transition][pp \rightarrow CNO transition]]).

- *Very low M main sequence \Rightarrow fully convective*

For the lowest-mass stars, T_{eff} remains cold and the opacity remains
high: they burn through the pp cycle, but remain /convective/ throughout
the main sequence. In this case, /all/ of the stellar material is
available to burn, there is no core/envelope structure at all! These
stars however have (relatively speaking) very low L, thus they evolve
very slowly. All these stars are still on the main-sequence! This is
the case of the 0.3M_{\odot} star you computed for a homework, which has
an approximately polytropic EOS because it is fully convective, thus
has \nabla=\nabla_{ad} \Rightarrow P\propto\rho^{\Gamma_{1}}.

- *Low M main sequence \Rightarrow radiative core, convective envelope*

Moving slightly higher in mass, meaning also to higher T_{eff}, a
radiative core appears. the burning is very concentrated in the
innermost region, but they are cool enough to have high \kappa at the
surface, and thus retain a convective /envelope/:

*N.B.:* we are seeing that the cooler T_{eff} is the deeper the convective
envelope! Increasing T_{eff} the convective layer disappear in the
deepest layers.

- *High M main sequence \Rightarrow convective core, radiative envelope*

Increasing M \Leftrightarrow T_{eff} further, the equilibrium condition L=L_{nuc} cannot
be satisfied anymore with the pp-chain, and the CN-NO bi-cycle kicks
in. Because of its higher Coulomb barriers, it has a steeper
temperature dependence: the energy release is even more concentrated,
implying that \nabla in the core is very steep (recall \nabla\prop \kappa L \prop \kappa L_{nuc}),
thus /the core becomes convective/. This means that convective mixing
makes a larger mass of hydrogen available to the very central burning
zone. At the same time, higher M \Rightarrow higher T_{eff} and the envelope
becomes radiative.

#+CAPTION: The "initial" gravothermal equilibrium structure of a star is determined only by mass M and composition. The figure (Fig. 9.8 in Onno Pols' notes, modified from Kippenhahn & Weigert) shows in gray the region in mass coordinate y=m/M that are convective as a function of the total mass M=\int dm for Z=0.02 models. Red lines indicate where 50 and 90 % of the luminosity L is generated (the "burning region") and the blue dashed lines show r(m)=0.25M and r(m)=0.5M.

** Evolution during the main sequence
During the main sequence L steadily increases on \tau\sim\tau_{nuc}. This is
because the conversion of hydrogen into helium decreases X (and
increases Y), which enter in two key quantities, mean molecular weight
and electron scattering opacity:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:microphysics_XY}
\mu \simeq \frac{1}{2X+\frac{3}{4}Y+\frac{Z}{2}} \ \ , \\
\kappa_\mathrm{es} = 0.2(1+X) \ \ \mathrm{cm^{2}\ g^{-1}} \ \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
Assuming a star to be in gravothermal equilibrium and assuming
radiative energy transport (which we have just seen is not verified
everywhere by =MESA-web= models!), we know that:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:L_scaling}
L\propto \frac{\mu^{4} M^{3}}{\kappa} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
This scaling relation is
approximate and does not exactly hold if a star is not fully
radiative, but it tells that:
- the higher \kappa, that is, the harder it is for photons to get out, the
  lower the luminosity
- the higher the mass, the higher the luminosity (\Rightarrow the higher the
  nuclear burning rate for a given fuel!), and since the mass exponent
  is larger than 1, this implies that /more massive stars have shorter
  lifetimes w.r.t. lower mass stars/. They do have more fuel available
  (\propto M), but they burn through it at a higher rate (\prop M^{3})! In fact
  stellar lifetimes of stars which end up burning all the way to iron
  (M_{ZAMS}\ge7.5M_{\odot}, with the exact lower limit depending on Z,
  rotation, binary interactions, cf. for example [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PASA...34...56D/abstract][Doherty et al. 2017]]
  and [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850..197P/abstract][Poelarends et al. 2017]])
- the higher the mean molecular weight \mu (= number of particles per
  baryonic mass), the higher the luminosity.

Using Eq. \ref{eq:L_scaling} we can infer that the high power of \mu
drives the luminosity evolution of the stars during the main sequence:
because hydrogen is converted into helium (X \rightarrow Y), the mass-weighted
average \langle \mu \rangle = \int dm \mu(m)/\int dm increases and thus L increases.

*N.B.:* massive and low mass stars however have a very different
morphology of the main sequence. For stars with radiative cores
(burning through the pp-chain, M\le1.2M_{\odot}), L increases, R varies
little, thus since L=4\pi R^{2}\sigma T_{eff}^{4} in equilibrium, we also see a
slight increase in temperature of the star during the main sequence.
Conversely, massive stars with convective cores (burning through the
CNO cycle, M\geq1.2M_{\odot}) increase in radius and actually become /cooler/
as they evolve during the main sequence. One can derive (see Onno
Pols' notes chapter 7) analytic R(M) relations assuming a specific
scaling for the energy generation to qualitatively explain this. In
reality, the details of the core evolution (influenced by uncertain
processes such as convective boundary mixing) and envelope (influenced
by wind uncertainties) matter for the details.

*N.B.:* The relative role of \mu and \kappa is slightly sensitive to
metallicity too (because at lower Z the approximation \kappa\simeq\kappa_{es} is
progressively better since fewer bound-bound and bound-free
transitions are available, see also [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.5816X/abstract][Xin et al. 2022]]). The opacity \kappa is
dominant in determining the L and R at ZAMS for Z\simeq0.02, but the change
in \mu is determining their /evolution/ along the main sequence.

:Question:
- *Q*: based on the scaling in Eq. \ref{eq:L_scaling}, how does the
  luminosity of two identical stars differing only in Z compare? Which
  star has the highest L? (*Hint*: you can compute more =MESA-web= models
  of your mass varying Z to check your answer!)
:end:

Looking at the Kippenhahn diagrams and composition diagrams from
=MESA-web= we can also see what the model does in the core (something
not /directly/ accessible to observations - if not through neutrinos).

For low mass stars with radiative cores and high \rho_{center} (something
you can derive from the virial theorem + hydrostatic equilibrium +
EOS), partial degeneracy already plays a role in sustaining the
structure during the main sequence, and as the central burning region
converts hydrogen into helium, the helium core becomes hot and
degenerate - thus sustaining itself against gravitational collapse
with the quantum effects due to the Fermi-Dirac statistics of
electrons.

Conversely, high mass stars have a convective core: convective mixing
connects the innermost burning region with a larger fuel reservoir.
The progressive burning of hydrogen changes the center opacity (well
approximated by electron scattering only in the hot, fully ionized
interior) \kappa\simeq\kappa_{es}=0.2(1+X) cm^{2} g^{-1}. Specifically, as X decreases, so
does \kappa, and since \nabla = \partial ln(T)/\partial ln(\rho) \propto \kappa L, the temperature gradient
becomes "less steep", meaning there is less need for convection:
/during the main sequence of massive stars, the convective core
receeds in mass coordinate/.

* End of the main sequence

*** "Low" mass stars with radiative cores

Very low mass stars smoothly evolve off the main sequence: if you look
at the T(\rho) diagram in the movie produced by =MESA-web=, from the
outlines of the track you can see where the nuclear burning moves.

#+CAPTION: Screenshot of a =MESA-web= calculation of a 1M_{\odot} star shortly after the main sequence. The HRD (bottom left) shows a smooth end of the main sequence, and the Kippenhahn diagram and T(\rho) tracks (middle) show that all the burning is in a shell surrouding the inert He core. The bottom right panel shows that the inner region as a flattening T profile because of conduction efficiently transporting energy and erasing the dT/dr.

[[./images/1Msun_TAMS.png]]

Since these are stars that were burning radiatively (the fully
convective ones have not yet finished their main sequence even if they
had been burning since the birth of the Universe!), they have just
outside the region hot enough for hydrogen burning fresh fuel
available that has not been mixed in the burning region. Therefore,
*hydrogen ignites in a shell* around the now H-depleted, He-rich core.

Because of the gap in T to bridge the Coulomb barriers for
hydrogen-burning and 3\alpha, Helium core burning does /not/ ignite
immediately: the Helium core sits inert, contracts, degeneracy
pressure starts to matter and conduction becomes important, leading to
an almost /isothermal/ He core sitting below the H shell.

The morphology of the end of the main sequence for low mass stars with
radiative cores is /smooth/: the core contracts, the shell above it
contracts and it is immediately hot enough to burn. The temperature of
the shell is determined by the /contraction/ of the inert He core,
rather than by the energy generation by nuclear physics. Therefore,
the shell is typically becoming hot enough to burn through the CNO
cycle even for a low mass star.

*** "High" mass stars with convective cores

Increasing the mass above the threshold for activating the CN-NO
bi-cycle (somewhere \sim1.1-1.3M_{\odot} depending on assumptions), the
morphology of the end of the main sequence changes.

#+CAPTION: Screenshot of a =MESA-web= calculation of a 30M_{\odot} star shortly after the main sequence. The HRD (bottom left) shows the "Henyey hook" feature, the Kippenhahn diagran and T(\rho) track shows that there is an off-center H-burning shell but the He in the core ignites promptly too. The core is not degenerate, but convective again, and mantains a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/30Msun_TAMS.png]]

:Question:
- *Q*: for your =MESA-web= models, what is the highest mass with a
  radiative main sequence core, and the lowest with convective main
  sequence core?
:end:

In this case, during the main sequence the /burning/ is even more
centralized in mass and radius coordinate than for lower-mass
pp-chain-sustained stars, but that drives /convection/. Therefore,
convective mixing refuels the burning region from a larger reservoir,
and when the fuel runs out, it means that there is a gap in the star
between where T is hot enough for nuclear reactions and where viable
fuel is. This causes an "overall contraction phase", also known as
"Henyey hook", where the star, out of energy sources resumes its
gravothermal collapse and shrinks in radius.

This process increases the temperature profile until the H-rich fuel
left at the edge of the convective core ignites in a shell. However,
the He core below, whose mass is set by the extent of convection
(+convective boundary mixing) during the main sequence, is too big to
be sustained by electron degeneracy pressure and too hot to be
degenerate (recall that \langle T \rangle \prop \mu M/R): below the shell the
contraction continues until He also promptly ignites!

* Helium ignition and burning

(in construction)

** Low mass star "flashes"

** High mass stars


* Late evolution

** Low mass stars: thermal pulses and WD cooling

After the end of He core burning, the /vast/ majority of stars (\sim 98% of
all stars integrating over the birth-mass distribution for M_{ZAMS}\le
7.5M_{\odot}) is left with a carbon/oxygen rich degenerate core which is
not massive enough to ignite further nuclear burning, and electron
degeneracy sustains it. These stars however still need to lose their
H-rich extended envelope and He-rich shell (which remain temporarily
sustained by nuclear burning in shells) before they can finally rest
as white dwarfs entirely sustained by degeneracy pressure. This
process is relatively fast and involves copious episodic stellar
outflows which are still an active topic of research.

A star in this phase is referred to as an "Asymptotic Giant Branch"
(AGB) star: for most of its life the He layer is inert (no nuclear
burning) and (partially) degenerate too, and it grows in mass because
of the ashes of the overlaying H-burning shell, which sustains the
H-rich envelope above it.

As the He layer grows in mass, it temporarily ignites: this energy
release causes a /flash/ (similar to He ignition in low mass stars in
the first place), and expands the He layer, pushing outward the inner
boundary of the H-shell, often until its density becomes too low for
H-burning. Thus, as a consequence of the He shell flash, matter is
pushed out and cools (possibly forming dust and increasing \kappa and thus
the mass loss from the star), the H shell shuts off, but the He shell
too does. This is because the flash was not hydrostatic self-regulated
burning! The outer layers then re-collapse on a thermal timescale and
as they contract, the H-burning shell ignites first (it's easier to
burn H than He!), returning to the initial situation, but with a
little less mass. This process of "thermal AGB pulses" ultimately will
lead to the loss of all the H and He, leaving a "bare" CO core exposed.

*N.B.:* ignition in a (partially) degenerate environment causes an
abrupt increase in T and thus P from the ideal gas EOS, but the
environment was supported by a T-independent degeneracy pressure: this
leads to a discontinuity in time of the pressure and thus a /dynamical/
event, referred to as a Flash. This can also occur in the core of
massive stars!

#+CAPTION: T(\rho) diagram of a 1M_{\odot} =MESA-web= model during an AGB thermal pulse. Note the temperature inversion in the core, the presence of 2 burning shells in this snapshot (the He shell marked by the orange outline and the H shell marked by the yellow outline).
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/Trho_TPAGB.png]]

*N.B.:* because of \nu cooling, in AGB stars the center cools faster than
the layers above it: this can lead to a "temperature inversion". At
the boundary between this evolutionary end and the end of massive
stars, the so-called "super-AGB" stars will ignite C off-center, but
the ignition of carbon will then move inwards (in a \sim meter thin
shell) until it reaches the center, lifting the electron degeneracy by
releasing nuclear energy, and allowing the star to evolve past C core
burning.

After losing their envelopes to thermal pulses (possibly accompanied
by a late enhancement of their stellar winds), low mass stars rapidly
move from the top right (high L low T_{eff}) corner of the HR diagram to
the lower left (low L high T_{eff}) corner becoming white dwarfs (WD):
this process of contraction occurs on a thermal timescale. In WDs the
gravothermal collapse stops because of the electron degeneracy
pressure: the degeneracy decoupled their structure (which can be
approximated assuming k_{B}T\ll \varepsilon_{Fermi} \Rightarrow T\simeq 0)
and their radiative properties.

These sit in the bottom left corner of the HR diagram: they actually
have /hotter/ surface temperatures compared to a main sequence star!
This high T means they do radiate and lose energy, but because of the
small radius (R\simeq0.01R_{\odot}\simeq 1000km) they have a low luminosity
L=4\pi R^{2} \sigma T_{eff}: their radiative cooling is very slow (timescale
of billions of years). The WD will just "slide down slowly" on a
cooling track.

*N.B.:* Because of the M(R) relation for non-relativistic electron
degeneracy gas in hydrostatic equilibrium, the /lower mass WDs have
larger R/, thus for a given T_{eff}, they also have /higher L/.

*** The /Gaia/ spur: observational evidence for crystallization

As the WD cools, its core density increases, and its degenerate plasma
will at some point crystallize. This phase transition releases latent
heat thus slows down the cooling: in isochrones of WD populations we
should expect an overabundance of stars in the region where we expect
crystallization to occur, and this was tentatively observed thanks to
the /Gaia/ DR2 dataset for WDs within 100pc from Earth ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Natur.565..202T/abstract][Tremblay et al.
2019]]):

#+CAPTION: HR diagram for a WD sample within 100pc from /Gaia/ DR2. The color of points indicates spectroscopically determined masses based on SDSS, red dots mark magnetized WD (again from their spectra), and dotted orange lines enclose the predicted region where crystallization of the WD covers between 20% (top) and 80% of the total mass, and contains an overabundance of stars as predicted by the release of latent heat. This is Fig. 2 from [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Natur.565..202T/abstract][Tremblay et al. 2019]]

*N.B.:* Crystallization of a C-rich WD makes a stellar-mass, Earth-size
diamond!

Other physical phenomena that can influence the evolution of WDs is
the gravitational sedimentation of the composition, with heavier
elements sinking and lighter elements rising, and for sufficiently
high L (young WDs) there can also be radiative levitation, where the
most opaque elements (typically the primordial iron present) will be
pushed upwards by radiation.

** High mass stars: \nu speedup the evolution
