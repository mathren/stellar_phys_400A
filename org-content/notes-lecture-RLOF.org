* Mass transfer in binary systems
*Materials*: Onno Pols' lecture notes Chapter 7,8, Tauris & van den
Heuvel book chapter 4,

We have already seen in the [[./notes-lecture-BIN.org::*Binaries are common][second lecture]] that, in the Universe,
binary systems composed of two stars orbiting each other are common,
the higher the mass of the stars the more so (see for example [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ASPC..534..275O/abstract][Offner
et al. 2023]]). Historically, this fact has been leveraged to design
empirical /dynamical mass measurement/ which rely only on Kepler's laws
to obtain masses.

However, often enough, stars in binaries are so close to each other
than as they evolve, they will "touch" each other and exchange mass.
In today's lecture we will discuss in more detail how being in a
binary can lead to dramatic consequences for the evolution of /both/
stars in the system, starting with the Roche model of the potential.

** Roche model

To describe the gas of the stars in a binary system subject to the
gravity of both stars is effectively a /three body problem/, hard to
solve even before we fold in anything else but gravity.

A useful approximation often used is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Roche][Roche]] model of the
gravitational potential. This is based on the following key
assumptions:

1. e=0: the mutual orbit of M_{1} and M_{2} is circular;
2. M_{1} and M_{2} are treated as point masses;
3. M_{1} \geq M_{2} \gg m: the masses of the two stars are much larger than
   the test mass m we consider to map the potential;

These defined the /restricted circular three body problem/. Of these
assumptions the most restrictive is perhaps the first: binaries can be
eccentric, and updates to this model to account for that are actively
being developed (e.g., [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...702.1387S/abstract][Sepinsky 2009]]). The second assumption is not
critical, since the density increases steeply moving inwards in the
star: /most of the mass is in the center/. The last assumption is
typically easily verified as long as one considers small parcels of
gas.

With these three assumptions, one can put themselves in a *frame
centered in the binary center of mass and co-rotating with the binary*
at frequency \Omega=2\pi/P. Since it is a rotating frame, it is non-inertial,
but the gravitational potential of the two stars can be written as:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\Phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{GM_{1}}{\lvert \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{1}\rvert}-\frac{GM_{2}}{\lvert \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{2}\rvert}-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{\Omega}\times\mathbf{r})^{2} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
Where r_{i} is the distance to M_{i} (considered a point-mass), so the first
two terms represent the gravity of each star, respectively, and the
last term represents the centrifugal force.

Taking the gradient, the gravitational force from the combined masses
of the stars in the binary is F=-\nabla V(\mathbf{r}). But because we are
in non-inertial frame, there is also another term to add to the
momentum equation which cannot be expressed as a potential, because it
depends on the velocity of the test mass m: the Coriolis force \prop
2\Omega\times v. Per unit volume the momentum conservation is thus

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\partial_{t} v + (v\cdot\nabla )v = -\nabla \Phi-\frac{\nabla P}{\rho}-2\mathbf{\Omega}\times \mathbf{v} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

Finally, one could also relax the hypothesis 2. above and include a
tidal term due to the finite size of the stars in the potential (this
again works because most of the mass of the star is in it's core,
saving the Roche model, and the tides are a relatively small
perturbation on top of this):

On the line connecting the two binaries, this potential has three
zeros, meaning points where there is no net force. All three are
/saddle points/ and they are called Lagrangian points:
- L_{1} sits in between the two stars, and it is the point where the
  gravitational pull from each star cancel each other
- L_{2} is the point behind star 2 (many telescopes, including for
  example /JWST/ sit at the L_{2} point of the Earth-Sun binary system)
- L_{3} is the point behind star 1.

The equipotential shapes are close to spheres for r_{1} and/or r_{2} \ll
r_{L{1}}, then they get progressively elongated along the axis connecting
the stars, and flattened by the centrifugal potential.

For short period binaries, P<10 days (though the exact value depends
on many things, especially mass M_{1}, mass ratio q=M_{2}/M_{1}, metallicity,
etc.), we observe that the stars co-rotate with the orbit, that is
there is complete /tidal synchronization/. In that case, in the
co-rotating frame, the gas of both stars is still, $\mathbf{v}=0$, and
the momentum conservation reduces to

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
- \rho \nabla\Phi = \nabla P \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
that is equipotential surfaces are also isobaric surfaces (\nabla\Phi = 0 \Leftrightarrow \nabla
P=0), and since \rho \sim dP/d\Phi has to remain finite, it is also constant on
these surfaces!

Therefore, for a tidally synchronized binary the stellar gas will be
shaped like equipotential surfaces in the Roche potential, producing
non-axisymmetric, tear-drop-shaped stars.

For larger periods, tidal synchronization may not occur (tides are a
steep function of R/a), and in that case the rotational bulge may lag
behind the orbit, adding an extra deformation.

On top of the necessary hypothesis (e=0, M_{1 }\ge M_{2} \gg m, point masses
and in co-rotation) to derive the Roche approximation, it is worth
noting that for r\gg r_{L_{2}} the Roche model becomes less and less
physically meaningful. By construction, it is based on the assumption
of co-rotation with the binary, but a parcel of gas significantly
outside L_{2} will not maintain this co-rotation, an it is more likely to
only "see" the inner binary as a point mass with total mass M_{1}+M_{2}.

The dotted line outside of L_{2} mark where co-rotation is not achievable and the Roche approximations don't hold anymore. The dark gray binary with both stars within their Roche lobes is a /detached/ binary, the intermediate gray one, where M_{1} fills its Roche lobe is a /semidetached/ binary, and the lightest gray where both stars fill their lobes is a contact binary. This is Figure 6.1 of Onno Pols' lecture notes.

*** Spherical approximation

The Roche potential is /clearly/ not spherically symmetric: how can we
use this in stellar evolution simulations?! In reality, thanks to the
fact that in depth, the potential is very closed to spherically
symmetric, and most of the deformation is in a large by radius by
extremely small in mass region of the star (nevertheless important for
atmospheric effects and observable predictions!). So for the stellar
/interior/ calculation, the spherical symmetry is still acceptable for
most of the mass domain and as long as the stars are detached (see
below).

Each Roche lobe can then be interpreted as the /sphere of gravitational
influence/ of each star.

What we need to know then is the /volume/ of each Roche lobe, and we can
then /define/ a sphere that has the same volume and compare the volume
of the stellar gas to the volume of such sphere. There are multiple
formulae to fit the Roche volume as a function of the binary
parameters (e.g., [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1971ARA%26A...9..183P/abstract][Paczsynki 1971]]), but probably the most common one is
[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ApJ...268..368E/abstract][Eggleton 1983]]'s formula, which provides a fit accurate to \sim1% and
continuous across a large range of mass ratios:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
R_{RL,i}= a \frac{0.49 q_{i}^{2/3}}{0.6q_{i}^{2/3}+\ln(1+q_{i}^{2/3})} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where a is the orbital separation, q_{i} = M_{i}/M_{j}, and 4\pi R_{RL,i}^{3}/3 \sim Roche
volume of star i.


* Type of binary interactions
As we will see in the next in class activity, stars tend to grow
bigger as the evolve: even a binary system that stars as detached may
come into contact as the stars evolve, triggering the onset of mass
transfer between the stars in the binary system. In fact, gas reaching
L_{1} will be equally bound to either stars, and it can easily be
perturbed to fall into the other star.

Depending on the stability of the /orbital response/ to the
transfer of mass, we distinguish two cases:

** Dynamically stable mass-transfer
If Roche lobe overflow does not hit a runaway response of the orbit
(causing more and more overflow), then it is dynamically stable.

This will occur in the vast majority of massive stars, and it can have
important consequences for /both/ stars that will be modified by this
interaction:
- the donor typically will lose most or all it's hydrogen rich
  envelope, becoming a hot, Helium rich, compact star
- the accretor will be spun up and polluted by material from the
  companion, becoming a fast rotating and overluminous star.
- if the accretor has a convective core, increasing M will because of
  the virial theorem increase \langle T \rangle, and facilitate a growth in mass
  coordinate of the core, allowing the burning region to access more
  fuel and thus rejuvenating the star.

** Dynamically unstable common envelope
Sometimes, the orbit and or the evolution of the stars respond to mass
transfer increasing the amount of overflow, leading to an unstable
situation: in this case the system enters in contact first, and then
ultimately in a common envelope event.

During a common envelope the gas of the envelope of both stars fills
equipotentials beyond L_{2}, cannot maintain co-rotation, and thus start
exerting a friction on the orbit of the two cores (or core and star)
inside this shared envelope.

This results in an inspiral that can end either with:
 - a stellar merger
 - the successful ejection of the shared envelope (interrupting the
   drag), and the formation of a tight period binary

** Nomenclature: Case A, B, and C
Depending on when mass transfer starts, we can have three different
categories (defined by [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1967ZA.....66...58K/abstract][Kippenhahn et al. 1967]] and [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1970A%26A.....7..150L/abstract][Lauterborn 1970]]):
  - case A RLOF: donor is burning hydrogen in its core
  - case B RLOF: the donor has a helium core (possibly inert and
    sustained by electron degeneracy or burning)
  - case C RLOF: for low mass stars, this is typically defined after
    He ignition, for high mass stars, it is typically defined after
    core He depletion
Because of the different L and \varphi factors for each nuclear burning
phase, the timescales and therefore responses of both stars and the
orbit to mass transfer can be very different for these three: case A
typically has a short thermal timescale phase, followed by nuclear
timescale mass transfer. Case B and C tend to be faster (thermal
timescale or shorter), though this may also be metallicity dependent
(see e.g., [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...662A..56K/abstract][Klencki et al. 2022]]).

- *Q*: if there is matter flowing through L_{1}, can it be convective at
  that radius?
