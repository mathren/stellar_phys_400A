We have already seen in the [[./notes-lecture-BIN.org::*Binaries are common][second lecture]] that, in the Universe,
binary systems composed of two stars orbiting each other are common,
the higher the mass of the stars the more so (see for example [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ASPC..534..275O/abstract][Offner
et al. 2023]]). Historically, this fact has been leveraged to design
empirical /dynamical mass measurement/ which rely only on Kepler's laws
to obtain masses.

However, often enough, stars in binaries are so close to each other
than as they evolve, they will "touch" each other and exchange mass.
In today's lecture we will discuss in more detail how being in a
binary can lead to dramatic consequences for the evolution of /both/
stars in the system, starting with the Roche model of the potential.

** Roche model

To describe the gas of the stars in a binary system subject to the
gravity of both stars is effectively a /three body problem/, hard to
solve even before we fold in anything else but gravity.

A useful approximation often used is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Roche][Roche]] model of the
gravitational potential. This is based on the following key
assumptions:

1. e=0: the mutual orbit of M_{1} and M_{2} is circular;
2. M_{1} and M_{2} are treated as point masses;
3. M_{1} \geq M_{2} \gg m: the masses of the two stars are much larger than
   the test mass m we consider to map the potential;

These defined the /restricted circular three body problem/. Of these
assumptions the most restrictive is perhaps the first: binaries can be
eccentric, and updates to this model to account for that are actively
being developed (e.g., [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...702.1387S/abstract][Sepinsky 2009]]). The second assumption is not
critical, since the density increases steeply moving inwards in the
star: /most of the mass is in the center/. The last assumption is
typically easily verified as long as one considers small parcels of
gas.

With these three assumptions, one can put themselves in a *frame
centered in the binary center of mass and co-rotating with the binary*
at frequency \Omega=2\pi/P. Since it is a rotating frame, it is non-inertial,
but the gravitational potential of the two stars can be written as:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
V(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{GM_{1}}{\lvert \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{1}\rvert}-\frac{GM_{2}}{\lvert \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{2}\rvert}-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{\Omega}\timex\mathbr{r})^{2} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
Where r_{i} is the distance to M_{i} (considered a point-mass), so the first
two terms represent the gravity of each star, respectively, and the
last term represents the centrifugal force.

Taking the gradient, the gravitational force from the combined masses
of the stars in the binary is F=-\nabla V(\mathbf{r}). But because we are
in non-inertial frame, there is also another term to add to the
momentum equation which cannot be expressed as a potential, because it
depends on the velocity of the test mass m: the Coriolis force \prop
2\mathbf{\Omega}\times \mathbf{v}. Per unit volume the momentum conservation is thus

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\partial_{t} v + (v\cdot\nabla )v = -\frac{\nabla V}{\rho}-\frac{\nabla P}{\rho}-2\mathbf{\Omega}\times \mathbf{v} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

Finally, one could also relax the hypothesis 2. above and include a
tidal term in the potential (this again works because most of the mass
of the star is in it's core, saving the Roche model, and the tides are
a relatively small perturbation on top of this.)
