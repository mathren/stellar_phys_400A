** Summary of where we are

We have four equations of the stellar /structure/ assuming spherical
symmetry, LTE, and hydrostatic (\partial t \equiv 0) equilibrium:

*** Mass continuity
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mass_cont}
\frac{dr}{dm} = \frac{1}{4\pi r^{2}\rho}\ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

*** Hydrostatic equilibrium
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HSE}
\frac{dP}{dm} = -\frac{Gm}{4\pi r^{4}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which follows from the momentum continuity equation

*** Equation of state
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
P_\mathrm{tot} = P_\mathrm{gas} + P_\mathrm{rad} = \frac{\rho}{\mu m_{u}}k_{B}T + P_{QM} + \frac{1}{3}aT^{4}  \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

*** Energy transport
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dm} = \frac{T}{P}\frac{dP}{dm}\nabla
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where \nabla =\partial log(T)/\partial log(P) is the local temperature gradient, equal to
the radiative gradient in stably stratified regions:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\mathrm{rad} = \frac{3 P}{14\pi acGm T^{4}}\kappa L
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
with \kappa = (1/\kappa_{rad} + 1/\kappa_{cond})^{-1} the combination "in parallel" of the
radiative and conductive opacity (assumed to be known from atomic
physics), and \nabla \equiv \nabla_{ad} the adiabatic gradient (within \sim10^{-7-8}
precision) for convective regions. We also have a criterion
(Schwarzschild criterion) to determine which region is which.

*** Energy conservation
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dm} = \varepsilon_\mathrm{nuc} -\varepsilon_{\nu} + \varepsilon_\mathrm{grav} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

with \varepsilon_{grav} = T\partial s/\partial t the change in internal energy.

** The next step

With all the equations above we almost have a complete set of solvable
differential equations. What is left to discuss is the specific energy
generation per unit time \varepsilon_{nuc} due to nuclear burning and the specific
energy loss \varepsilon_{\nu} due to neutrino losses.

In doing so, we will introduce the only time-dependent equation: as
nuclear burning proceeds, the chemical composition changes, on a
timescale that we will see is extremely long compared to the thermal
and dynamical timescales.

** Energy generation as a self-regulating process

We have seen in the [[./notes-lecture-VirTheo.org][virial theorem lecture]] that one can derive from
first principle that stars have a "negative heat capacity" and obtain
a scaling between mass, radius and average temperature:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\langle T \rangle = \frac{2\mu m_{u}}{3} C \frac{GM^{}}{R} \propto \frac{\mu M}{R} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
As the star loses energy at the surface because of its luminosity L it
must contract (lower its gravitational potential energy), leading to
an increase in T. For the Sun this would go on for \sim 15 Myrs before it
runs out of all of its internal energy, which is way too short a
timescale to explain many Earthly observables.

We know this must stop either because the ideal gas EOS does not work
(QM effects \rightarrow degeneracy pressure \rightarrow white dwarfs), or because some
other energy source intervenes, balancing out the energy losses at the
surface. /Stars don't shine because they burn, stars burn because they
shine/.

Initially, people considered chemical reactions and radioactivity as a
possible energy sources, but it was shown very quickly that these are
insufficient. It took major advances in quantum mechanics and their
application to atomic and nuclear theory to work out in the late 1930s
that the energy source is nuclear burning, a result obtained by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe][Hans
Bethe]] and collaborators.

In a sense, you can think  of a star as an /inertial confinement nuclear
reactor/ where the confinement is provided by the self-gravity. This
also implies that nuclear burning in a star is a /self-regulating/
process: because nuclear reactions are a consequence of the energy
losses, during long-lived equilibrium phases of the stellar life, they
produce just enough energy to balance the losses! In other words,
L_{nuc} = L ( + L_{\nu}).

If a star were to not produce enough energy to verify that (i.e.,
L>L_{nuc}), then it will lose too much energy, meaning it will contract,
and increase it's temperature because of the virial theorem, which in
turn regulates the energy generation by nuclear reactions (as we will
see in a moment), until L_{nuc} reaches L.
Viceversa, if L_{nuc} > L for some reason (e.g., there is a thermonuclear
explosion in the star), than the extra energy release will cause an
expansion of the star and by the virial theorem lower the mean
temperature until L_{nuc} = L.

** The nuclear timescale

Naturally, nuclear energy generation consumes nuclear fuel: to provide
L_{nuc} the composition of the star slightly changes in time. This drives
the /evolution/ of star.

We can estimate the timescale for this assuming the star is in
gravothermal equilibrium, so L=L_{nuc}. The /nuclear timescale/ is the time
it takes to lose the energy generated by nuclear reactions:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\tau_\mathrm{nuc} = \varphi f_\mathrm{burn} \frac{Mc^{2}}{L_\mathrm{nuc}} \equiv \varphi f_\mathrm{burn} \frac{Mc^{2}}{L_{}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

where \phi is the fraction of rest mass of nuclei converted in energy by
nuclear burning, f_{burn} is the fraction of the stellar mass M that is
affected by burning (we need a stellar model to estimate that).
For the Sun, f_{burn} \simeq 0.1 from detailed models (as you can verify
with your =MESA-web= model!).

\phi depends on the nuclear physics details. For hydrogen burning into
helium (the two lightest elements), the proton mass is m_{p} = 1.0081 m_{u}
(where the atomic mass unit m_{u} is defined in such a way that the mass
of carbon 12 is exactly 12 - this is more convenient to measure
experimentally to make a standard), and the mass of helium 4 is m(^{4}He)
= 4.0039m_{u}, so the fraction of rest mass of 4 protons turning into a
helium nucleus is:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\varphi = \frac{4m_{p} - m(^{4}\mathrm{He})}{4m_{p}} \simeq 0.007 \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
Note that to turn 4 protons into a helium, because of charge and
leptonic number conservation, there needs to be 2 positrons and 2
neutrinos produced! Plugging in \phi and M_{\odot} and L_{\odot} we get for the nuclear
timescale:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tau_nuc_scaling}
\tau_\mathrm{nuc} \simeq 10^{10} \frac{f_\mathrm{burn}}{0.1} \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \ \mathrm{yr} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

So we now have estimates that allow us to see the complete
ordering for the main /global/ timescales for stellar evolution:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:timescale_ordering}
\tau_\mathrm{ff} \ll \tau_\mathrm{KH} \ll \tau_\mathrm{nuc} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

Moreover, Eq. \ref{eq:tau_nuc_scaling} shows that when accounting for
nuclear energy generation (which we have implicitly assumed here to
give a value of \phi), the nuclear timescale matches the timescale found
from geological evidence on Earth, and the ordering \ref{eq:timescale_ordering}
tells us that the evolution of the Sun is on a very slow timescale
compared to thermal and dynamical timescale, validating the
assumptions we made so far to derive the equations for stellar
/structure/ and allowing for a /quasi-static/ approximation to deal with
the stellar /evolution/.

Let's now dive into the details of the nuclear physics that allow for
nuclear burning.

** The energy reservoir: binding energy per nucleon

The energy reservoir that stars tap into is the nuclear binding
energy: nuclear reactions rearrange nucleons in nuclei to create more
bound configuration and extract binding energy as heat source.
Therefore, it is useful to consider the nuclear binding energy per
nucleon of all nuclei in the periodic table:

#+CAPTION: Nuclear binding energy per nucleon as a function of atomic mass A. From [[https://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-05062015-125630/unrestricted/Thesis_colored_10052015.pdf][Renzo 2015]]
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/nuclear_binding.png]]

This plot shows empirical data, and there are several notable features
coming from the internal structure of the nuclei that any model of
nuclear (strong) interactions needs to explain:
- the binding energy per nucleon raises sharply with A among the light
  nuclei;
- the helium nucleus (\alpha particle) has an exceptionally high binding
  energy per nucleon of \sim 7.5MeV/nucleon;
- there are peaks for nuclei with A divisible by 4 and N=Z, that is
  nuclei that can be approximately thought as bound collections of \alpha
  particles (for example carbon 12 \sim 3 \alpha particles bound together,
  oxygen 16 ~4 \alpha particles, etc..);
- the nuclear binding energy is roughly constant at about \sim
  8MeV/nucleon for most heavy nuclei;
- there is a local /maximum/ of the binding energy per nucleon at the
  iron group, around iron 56/nickel 62.


*N.B.:* The slight drop in B/A after the maximum is caused by the
Coulomb repulsion between the protons in heavy nuclei, and this is why
those nuclei require a higher number of neutrons than protons to hold
together, N>Z.

The last fact implies that there cannot be energy release from the
/fusion/ of nuclei heavier than iron: indeed those heavy nuclei are
typically fuel for nuclear fission reactors, where energy is extracted
breaking them apart. Stars, which do nuclear burning to /release/ energy
and balance the losses at the surface, have no interest in producing
element heavier than iron during their stable/hydrostatic lifetime.
The question of the formation of elements heavier than iron (which
clearly exist!) is something that is actively worked on and requires
out-of-equilibrium processes that can only occur in the presence of a
neutron rich environment (e.g., AGB stellar winds, neutron stars
interacting with something else, etc.). We may have a guest lecture on
this later on, and there are projects related to these.

Conversely, moving leftward on this chart, by fusing together light
nuclei, stars can release gravitational binding energy and sustain
themselves. This is also great since stars are mostly made of H and
He, so they have a lot of light elements available as energy sources.

The change in binding energy per nucleon \Delta(B/A) is what powers stars,
and we can write the binding energy as the difference between the sum
of the masses of the Z protons (m_{p}) and N=A-Z neutrons (m_{n}) minus the
mass of the nucleus (measured experimentally):

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tau_nuc_scaling}
B = \left(Zm_{p}+(A-Z)m_{n} - m_\mathrm{nucleus}\right)c^{2} \simeq \left(Zm_{H}+(A-Z)m_{n} - m_\mathrm{nucleus}\right)c^{2} >0 \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which is a positive quantity precisely because the strong interaction
between protons and neutrons keeps them bound. In the second step, we
approximate the proton mass with the hydrogen atom mass, making a
mistake of the order of \sim 10 eV by neglecting the binding energy of
the electron (which is acceptable since we are dealing with MeV = 10^{6}^{}
eV as the relevant nuclear scale).

Because of the apparent peaks in the B/A vs. A curve, stars will tend
to produce more of the elements with the most tight nuclei, whose
production releases more energy! /The nuclear structure determines the
most abundant chemicals in the Universe/.

Moreover, from the fact that there is a sharp jump form H to He, and
then the curve rapidly flattens, we know that the rate at which nuclei
are converted to achieve the equilibrium condition L_{nuc} = L will be
slower when H is converted into He, and then it will need to rapidly
speed up when He is converted in carbon and onwards (because the
energy release per nucleon significantly drops).

In the very late evolutionary phases (post helium burning), the
required burning rate may become so high that L_{nuc} becomes shorter
than the /global/ thermal timescale (but luckily not of the /local/
thermal timescale, so all the equations we have derived so far still
hold, since they are differential equations that describe /local/
quantities). We will return on this [[https://www.as.arizona.edu/~mrenzo/materials/cores_of_massive_stars.pdf][later]].
