** Summary of where we are

We have four equations of the stellar /structure/ assuming spherical
symmetry, LTE, and hydrostatic (\partial t \equiv 0) equilibrium:

*** Mass continuity
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mass_cont}
\frac{dr}{dm} = \frac{1}{4\pi r^{2}\rho}\ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

*** Hydrostatic equilibrium
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HSE}
\frac{dP}{dm} = -\frac{Gm}{4\pi r^{4}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which follows from the momentum continuity equation

*** Equation of state
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
P_\mathrm{tot} = P_\mathrm{gas} + P_\mathrm{rad} = \frac{\rho}{\mu m_{u}}k_{B}T + P_{QM} + \frac{1}{3}aT^{4}  \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

*** Energy transport
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dm} = \frac{T}{P}\frac{dP}{dm}\nabla
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where \nabla =\partial log(T)/\partial log(P) is the local temperature gradient, equal to
the radiative gradient in stably stratified regions:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\mathrm{rad} = \frac{3 P}{14\pi acGm T^{4}}\kappa L
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
with \kappa = (1/\kappa_{rad} + 1/\kappa_{cond})^{-1} the combination "in parallel" of the
radiative and conductive opacity (assumed to be known from atomic
physics), and \nabla \equiv \nabla_{ad} the adiabatic gradient (within \sim10^{-7-8}
precision) for convective regions. We also have a criterion
(Schwarzschild criterion) to determine which region is which.

*** Energy conservation
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{dL}{dm} = \varepsilon_\mathrm{nuc} -\varepsilon_{\nu} + \varepsilon_\mathrm{grav} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

with \varepsilon_{grav} = T\partial s/\partial t the change in internal energy.

** The next step

With all the equations above we almost have a complete set of solvable
differential equations. What is left to discuss is the specific energy
generation per unit time \varepsilon_{nuc} due to nuclear burning and the specific
energy loss \varepsilon_{\nu} due to neutrino losses.

In doing so, we will introduce the only time-dependent equation: as
nuclear burning proceeds, the chemical composition changes, on a
timescale that we will see is extremely long compared to the thermal
and dynamical timescales.

** Energy generation as a self-regulating process

We have seen in the [[./notes-lecture-VirTheo.org][virial theorem lecture]] that one can derive from
first principle that stars have a "negative heat capacity" and obtain
a scaling between mass, radius and average temperature:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\langle T \rangle = \frac{2\mu m_{u}}{3} C \frac{GM^{}}{R} \propto \frac{\mu M}{R} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
As the star loses energy at the surface because of its luminosity L it
must contract (lower its gravitational potential energy), leading to
an increase in T. For the Sun this would go on for \sim 15 Myrs before it
runs out of all of its internal energy, which is way too short a
timescale to explain many Earthly observables.

We know this must stop either because the ideal gas EOS does not work
(QM effects \rightarrow degeneracy pressure \rightarrow white dwarfs), or because some
other energy source intervenes, balancing out the energy losses at the
surface. /Stars don't shine because they burn, stars burn because they
shine/.

Initially, people considered chemical reactions and radioactivity as a
possible energy sources, but it was shown very quickly that these are
insufficient. It took major advances in quantum mechanics (QM) and their
application to atomic and nuclear theory to work out in the late 1930s
that the energy source is nuclear burning, a result obtained by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe][Hans
Bethe]] and collaborators.

In a sense, you can think  of a star as an /inertial confinement nuclear
reactor/ where the confinement is provided by the self-gravity. This
also implies that nuclear burning in a star is a /self-regulating/
process: because nuclear reactions are a consequence of the energy
losses, during long-lived equilibrium phases of the stellar life, they
produce just enough energy to balance the losses! In other words,
L_{nuc} = L ( + L_{\nu}).

If a star were to not produce enough energy to verify that (i.e.,
L>L_{nuc}), then it will lose too much energy, meaning it will contract,
and increase it's temperature because of the virial theorem, which in
turn regulates the energy generation by nuclear reactions (as we will
see in a moment), until L_{nuc} reaches L.
Viceversa, if L_{nuc} > L for some reason (e.g., there is a thermonuclear
explosion in the star), than the extra energy release will cause an
expansion of the star and by the virial theorem lower the mean
temperature until L_{nuc} = L.

** The nuclear timescale

Naturally, nuclear energy generation consumes nuclear fuel: to provide
L_{nuc} the composition of the star slightly changes in time. This drives
the /evolution/ of star.

We can estimate the timescale for this assuming the star is in
gravothermal equilibrium, so L=L_{nuc}. The /nuclear timescale/ is the time
it takes to lose the energy generated by nuclear reactions:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\tau_\mathrm{nuc} = \varphi f_\mathrm{burn} \frac{Mc^{2}}{L_\mathrm{nuc}} \equiv \varphi f_\mathrm{burn} \frac{Mc^{2}}{L_{}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

where \phi is the fraction of rest mass of nuclei converted in energy by
nuclear burning, f_{burn} is the fraction of the stellar mass M that is
affected by burning (we need a stellar model to estimate that).
For the Sun, f_{burn} \simeq 0.1 from detailed models (as you can verify
with your =MESA-web= model!).

\phi depends on the nuclear physics details. For hydrogen burning into
helium (the two lightest elements), the proton mass is m_{p} = 1.0081 m_{u}
(where the atomic mass unit m_{u} is defined in such a way that the mass
of carbon 12 is exactly 12 - this is more convenient to measure
experimentally to make a standard), and the mass of helium 4 is m(^{4}He)
= 4.0039m_{u}, so the fraction of rest mass of 4 protons turning into a
helium nucleus is:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mass_defect}
\varphi = \frac{4m_{p} - m(^{4}\mathrm{He})}{4m_{p}} = \frac{2.85m_{u} c^{2}}{4m_{p}} \simeq 0.007 \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
Note that to turn 4 protons into a helium, because of charge and
leptonic number conservation, there needs to be 2 positrons and 2
neutrinos produced! Plugging in \phi and M_{\odot} and L_{\odot} we get for the nuclear
timescale:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tau_nuc_scaling}
\tau_\mathrm{nuc} \simeq 10^{10} \frac{f_\mathrm{burn}}{0.1} \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \ \mathrm{yr} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

So we now have estimates that allow us to see the complete
ordering for the main /global/ timescales for stellar evolution:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:timescale_ordering}
\tau_\mathrm{ff} \ll \tau_\mathrm{KH} \ll \tau_\mathrm{nuc} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

Moreover, Eq. \ref{eq:tau_nuc_scaling} shows that when accounting for
nuclear energy generation (which we have implicitly assumed here to
give a value of \phi), the nuclear timescale matches the timescale found
from geological evidence on Earth, and the ordering \ref{eq:timescale_ordering}
tells us that the evolution of the Sun is on a very slow timescale
compared to thermal and dynamical timescale, validating the
assumptions we made so far to derive the equations for stellar
/structure/ and allowing for a /quasi-static/ approximation to deal with
the stellar /evolution/.

Let's now dive into the details of the nuclear physics that allow for
nuclear burning.

** The energy reservoir: binding energy per nucleon

The energy reservoir that stars tap into is the nuclear binding
energy: nuclear reactions rearrange nucleons in nuclei to create more
bound configuration and extract binding energy as heat source.
Therefore, it is useful to consider the nuclear binding energy per
nucleon of all nuclei in the periodic table:

#+CAPTION: Nuclear binding energy per nucleon as a function of atomic mass A. From [[https://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-05062015-125630/unrestricted/Thesis_colored_10052015.pdf][Renzo 2015]]
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/nuclear_binding.png]]

This plot shows empirical data, and there are several notable features
coming from the internal structure of the nuclei that any model of
nuclear (strong) interactions needs to explain:
- the binding energy per nucleon raises sharply with A among the light
  nuclei;
- the helium nucleus (\alpha particle) has an exceptionally high binding
  energy per nucleon of \sim 7.5MeV/nucleon;
- there are peaks for nuclei with A divisible by 4 and N=Z, that is
  nuclei that can be approximately thought as bound collections of \alpha
  particles (for example carbon 12 \sim 3 \alpha particles bound together,
  oxygen 16 ~4 \alpha particles, etc..);
- the nuclear binding energy is roughly constant at about \sim
  8MeV/nucleon for most heavy nuclei;
- there is a local /maximum/ of the binding energy per nucleon at the
  iron group, around iron 56/nickel 62.


*N.B.:* The slight drop in B/A after the maximum is caused by the
Coulomb repulsion between the protons in heavy nuclei, and this is why
those nuclei require a higher number of neutrons than protons to hold
together, N>Z.

The last fact implies that there cannot be energy release from the
/fusion/ of nuclei heavier than iron: indeed those heavy nuclei are
typically fuel for nuclear fission reactors, where energy is extracted
breaking them apart. Stars, which do nuclear burning to /release/ energy
and balance the losses at the surface, have no interest in producing
element heavier than iron during their stable/hydrostatic lifetime.
The question of the formation of elements heavier than iron (which
clearly exist!) is something that is actively worked on and requires
out-of-equilibrium processes that can only occur in the presence of a
neutron rich environment (e.g., AGB stellar winds, neutron stars
interacting with something else, etc.). We may have a guest lecture on
this later on, and there are projects related to these.

Conversely, moving leftward on this chart, by fusing together light
nuclei, stars can release gravitational binding energy and sustain
themselves. This is also great since stars are mostly made of H and
He, so they have a lot of light elements available as energy sources.

The change in binding energy per nucleon \Delta(B/A) is what powers stars,
and we can write the binding energy as the difference between the sum
of the masses of the Z protons (m_{p}) and N=A-Z neutrons (m_{n}) minus the
mass of the nucleus (measured experimentally):

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
B = \left(Zm_{p}+(A-Z)m_{n} - m_\mathrm{nucleus}\right)c^{2} \simeq \left(Zm_{H}+(A-Z)m_{n} - m_\mathrm{nucleus}\right)c^{2} >0 \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which is a positive quantity precisely because the strong interaction
between protons and neutrons keeps them bound. In the second step, we
approximate the proton mass with the hydrogen atom mass, making a
mistake of the order of \sim 10 eV by neglecting the binding energy of
the electron (which is acceptable since we are dealing with MeV =
10^{6}eV as the relevant nuclear scale).

Because of the apparent peaks in the B/A vs. A curve, stars will tend
to produce more of the elements with the most tight nuclei, whose
production releases more energy! /The nuclear structure determines the
most abundant chemicals in the Universe/.

Moreover, from the fact that there is a sharp jump form H to He, and
then the curve rapidly flattens, we know that the rate at which nuclei
are converted to achieve the equilibrium condition L_{nuc} = L will be
slower when H is converted into He, and then it will need to rapidly
speed up when He is converted in carbon and onwards (because the
energy release per nucleon significantly drops).

In the very late evolutionary phases (post helium burning), the
required burning rate may become so high that L_{nuc} becomes shorter
than the /global/ thermal timescale (but luckily not of the /local/
thermal timescale, so all the equations we have derived so far still
hold, since they are differential equations that describe /local/
quantities). We will return on this [[https://www.as.arizona.edu/~mrenzo/materials/cores_of_massive_stars.pdf][later]].

*** Q-value
For any nuclear reaction that may happen a+X \rightarrow b+Y with a,b,X,Y
generic particles, it is useful to define the so called Q-value as the
mass difference between the reagents and the products:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
Q = \left((m_{a} + m_{X}) -(m_{b} + m_{Y}) \right)c^{2} = \Delta\left(\frac{B}{A}\right)c^{2}  \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which, if Q>0 is the energy /released/ by the /exoenergetic/ X(a,b)Y
reaction - of the kind that stars need to generate energy and sustain
themselves against gravity, or if Q<0 is the energy input needed to get the
/endoenergetic/ X(a,b)Y reaction going.

*N.B.:* In exoenergetic nuclear reactions, the energy release comes from
the /mass defect/, caused by the increase in binding energy per nucleon:
the total mass of the outgoing particles is lower than the ones
incoming because their binding energy is higher or in other words
their total energy is more negative.

The energy release by nuclear reaction per unit time and unit mass is
just:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_\mathrm{nuc} = \sum_{i} \frac{Q_{i} r_{i}}{\rho} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

where the sum runs over all the possible reactions, r_{i} is the rate per
unit time and volume of the reactions, and the division by the mass
density \rho gives the right dimensions [\varepsilon_{nuc}] = [E]/([t][M]).

So, what is left to do is calculate the volumetric reaction rate r_{i}
that can occur in a star.

** Microphysics of nuclear reactions

A generic nuclear reaction X+a \rightarrow Y+b is often written as X(a,b)Y to
make it easy to express chains of reactions, e.g.,
X(a,b)Y(c,d)Z(e,f)A...

Depending on the nature of the incoming particle (X and a in our
generic reaction), or in other words on the microphysics that
determines the interaction, there can be of various kinds of
reactions.

*** Charged-particles reactions
When X and a are charged nuclei, then the reaction can only occur if
something allows them to overcome the Coulomb repulsion.

These can be resonant or not (the distinction will come back later).

Example:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
 ^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

*** Reactions involving neutrons
In this case the force involved is the strong force, and there is no
Coulomb repulsion to overcome. However, these require an environment
that is neutron rich, which is astrophysically a rare occurrence,
since the neutron is an unstable particle that decays in \sim15min to
a proton n\rightarrow p+e^{-}+anti-\nu_{e}. This half-life however can significantly
change for neutrons bound in nuclei (as opposed to free neutrons).

Depending on the available flux of neutrons in the environment, we
distinguish:

- *r-process* for rapid neutron captures (i.e., the rate of neutron
  captures is high w.r.t. the rate of neutron decays)
- *s-process* for slow neutron captures (i.e., each nucleus captures at
  best one neutron before decaying).

These processes are involved in the formation of  elements heavier
than iron, but they require particular astrophysical environment
(e.g., the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star with the core
of another star, or the envelope of an AGB star).

*** Weak reactions
These can typically be spotted by the presence of a neutrino and/or
the conversion of a nucleon from one eigenstate of isospin to another
(in simpler words, the conversion of a proton into a neutron or
viceversa).

Example:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
p+e^{-} \rightarrow n+\nu_{e} \ \mathrm{or} \ p(e^{-},\nu_{e})n
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

*** Photodisintegrations
When one of the particles is a photon and the outgoing particles can
be seen as "fragments" of the ingoing nucleus. These can occur when
very energetic \gamma ray photons, because their energy needs to be
comparable to the binding energy of nuclei, of the order of ~8MeV, can
encounter particles. This can occur for example at the very late
moments of massive star evolution.

Example:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
^{56}\mathrm{Fe}+\gamma \rightarrow 14\alpha
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

** Nuclear reactions in stars

All of the types of reactions listed above (and more) can occur at
some point in the evolution (and explosion!) of stars. For example,
hen estimating the rest energy of protons that is released when fusing
them into \alpha particles, we have seen that the overall reaction is:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:overall_h_burn}
4p \rightarrow ^{4}\mathrm{He}+2e^{+} + 2\nu_{e} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where the positrons need to be there to conserve electric charge
throughout the process, and the neutrinos need to be there for
conserving the leptonic number (+1 for the leptons electron e^{-}, muon
\mu^{-}, tau \tau^{-} and the corresponding neutrinos \nu_{e}, \nu_{\mu}, \nu_{\tau} and -1
for their antiparticles positron e^{+}, positive muon \mu^{+}, and positive
\tau^{+} and the corresponding antineutrinos).

From Eq. \ref{eq:overall_h_burn} we can see that:
 - protons need to encounter each other. Statistically, 4 protons are
   unlikely to meet each other at a point in space for reaction Eq.
   \ref{eq:overall_h_burn} to occur. Eq. \ref{eq:overall_h_burn} is a
   compound reaction that "summarizes" the more complex burning
   process of H into He that we will detail later. Nevertheless, the
   process will necessarily involve charged particle reactions.
 - \nu_{e} appear \Rightarrow there will be weak reactions involved
 - as already seen earlier, we can calculate the \phi factor (cf. Eq.
   \ref{eq:mass_defect}), and thus the Q-value for the overall reaction
   Q_{H burn} \simeq 26.5 MeV. Note that the Q-value does not really depend on
   the details of the burning process.

*N.B.:* we discuss Eq. \ref{eq:overall_h_burn} because H is the most
abundant element in the Universe, that most stars are made of, and
thus this is (typically) the first process occurring in stars. It is
also the one with the highest Q-value (cf. B/A vs. A plot!), thus the
one that for a given luminosity L of the star can proceed at the
slowest rate and last the longest.

** Charged particle reactions

For the rest of this lecture we will focus mostly on charged particle
reactions: as we just saw these are involved since H core burning, and
they are the main reactions during the hydrostatic lifetime of stars.
Moreover, breakthroughs in QM (by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gamow][George Gamow]]) applied
to the interaction of charged particles are what opened the way to the
discovery that the energy source in stars are nuclear reactions.

*** Bohr's approximation

To discuss them, we will implicitly use /Bohr's approximation/, which is
not a completely accurate physical picture, but it is intuitive and
allows to describe the main processes occurring in nuclei. In this
approximation, we treat the generic reaction between charged particles
X(a,b)Y as if it went through an intermediate step of forming a
compound nucleus C:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
X + a \rightarrow C^{\star} \rightarrow Y + b \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where the nucleus C is formed in an excited state C^{\star} since in
the reference frame of X the particle a arrives with its own kinetic
energy and internal binding energy that (together with X's internal
energy) are generally not exactly the total energy for the compound
nucleus C.

The second step is the decay of this fictional compound excited
particle C^{\star} in the products Y and b.

In this approximation, the second step of the decay does /not/ depend on
the first step (in other words, C^{\star} loses the memory of how it
formed) as long as the half-life of C^{\star} is long compared to the
light-crossing time of C^{\star} itself. This is because we consider
charged particles by hypothesis, so electromagnetic forces mediated by
photons are what determines the interactions of the building blocks of
C^{\star}, and on a long timescale (cf. the light-crossing time) they
will equilibrate and lose memory of how they came to be.

The light crossing time of a nucleus can be estimated starting from
the experimental result on the size of nuclei (something that also
needs to be explained by models of the strong force):

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
r_\mathrm{n} = r_{0} A^{1/3} \simeq 1.4 \times 10^{-13} A^{1/3} \ \mathrm{cm} \Rightarrow \tau_\mathrm{light\ cross} = \frac{r_\mathrm{n}}{c} \simeq 10^{-23} A^{1/3} \ \mathrm{s} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
Any compound nucleus C^{\star }with lifetime longer than this allows us
to use this two step approximation to treat the problem, where the two
incoming particles X and a come "into contact" (i.e., within their
r_{n}), form an excited compound nucleus C^{\star}, which then de-excites
in the final products Y and b independently of how it formed.

*N.B.:* the nuclear radius dependence on A can be flipped around to
infer that the average density of nuclei is constant as A increases:
\rho_{n} \simeq Am_{u} / (4\pi/3 \times r_{n}^{3}) \simeq 2\times10^{14} A g cm^{-3}.

*N.B.:* this is necessarily an oversimplified picture, since nuclei are
described by QM and don't have a "hard" boundary at r_{n}, but rather
their constituent nucleons have decaying wave-functions that solve the
Schrodinger equation with the nuclear potential for their
interactions. In reality, each particle can be described as a wave
with De Broglie wavelength \lambda = h/p, and a physically more accurate
picture should treat all the particles involved accounting for their
wave nature.

To understand how two charged nuclei, both with positive charge, can "come into contact"
within r_{n}, we need to consider the potential governing their
interaction:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
V \equiv V(r) = V_\mathrm{Coulomb} + V_\mathrm{nuc} + \frac{\ell(\ell+1)\hbar^{2}}{2m_{aX}r^{2}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where the last term is the centrifugal potential in the rest-frame of
the target nucleus X which depends on the reduced mass m_{aX} =
m_{a}m_{X}/(m_{a}+m_{X}) and quantum number \ell which determines the order of the
wave-function of the system a+X. For simplicity, we can limit ourselves to
consider \ell=0: we already have a repulsive Coulomb term to win over,
and any extra repulsive term such a centrifugal barrier is only going
to lower the reaction rate. The most important reactions are going to
have \ell = 0, that is head-on collisions between a and X.

*** Coulomb potential term
For the Coulomb term we can write:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
V_\mathrm{Coulomb} = \frac{Z_{a}Z_{X}e^{2}}{r} - \{\mathrm{electron\ screening\ term}\} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where the first part is >0 and describes the electrostatic repulsion
between the two nuclei of chage Z_{a}e and Z_{X}e (both positive), and the
electron screening term /reduces/ the repulsion of the nuclei: in the
stellar plasma we expect each nucleus to be statistically surrounded
by a "cloud" of electrons of radius of the order of the Debye length
of the plasma:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
r_\mathrm{Debye} = \sqrt{\frac{k_{B}T}{4\pi e N\chi}} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where N is the total number of particles in absence of screening
(nuclei/ions+electrons), and \chi = \sum_{i} Z_{i}^{2} (N_{i}/N) + N_{e}/N with N_{i} and N_{e}
number of ions and electrons in absence of screening.

For distances between a and X larger than r_{Debye} the electron
screening reduces the Coulomb repulsion between the nuclei.

*** Nuclear potential term
Finally, for the nuclear potential, there isn't a well known
functional form from first principles, and it is typically derived
experimentally. This is because the strong interactions it is meant to
represent cannot be treated perturbatively. Typically, it can be
expressed in this form:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
V_\mathrm{nuc}(r) = a_\mathrm{vol} A - a_\mathrm{surf} A^{2/3} - a_\mathrm{Coulomb} \frac{Z^{2}}{A^{1/3}} - a_\mathrm{sym} \frac{(N-Z)^{2}}{A} + a_\mathrm{coupling} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where the coefficients a_{i} are experimentally derived. Each term has a
specific interpretation, keeping in mind the empirical relation for
the nuclear radius r_{n} \equiv r_{n}(A) \propto A^{1/3}:
- a_{vol} is the coefficient for a volume term, that is positive and
  expresses the fact that on short range nucleons attract (F_{n}=- \nabla
  V_{n}) each other and nuclei hold together.
- a_{surf} is a surface correction that decreases the previous term, and
  expresses the fact that nucleons at the edge of the nucleus feel
  the interaction with fewer other nucleons.
- a_{Coulomb} expresses the electromagnetic repulsion between protons
- a_{sym} expresses the fact that stable nuclei prefer to have N=Z (unless N>Z
  is necessary to increase A without increasing the Coulomb term for
  heavy nuclei)
- a_{coupling} \propto \pm A^{-3/4} which is >0 if both N and Z are even, <0
  if both are odd, and zero otherwise, is a term that expresses the
  fact that stable nuclei tend to prefer filling the energy levels for
  protons and neutrons, so they tend to prefer having an even number
  for each (one spin up and one spin down in each energy level).

Besides the nuclear physics details here, the important point is that
the nuclear potential is going to be attractive at short range, but it
has a repulsive core (otherwise the nuclei would not have a finite
approximately constant density), and goes to zero at large distances.

Putting things together we can sketch the following graph for the
potential felt by particle a and generated by the strong and
electromagnetic force by particle X:

- at distances r \gg r_{Debye} electron screening nullifies the repulsive Coulomb potential
- for a relative energy at infinity of E, there is a distance of
  classical minimum approach r_{c}
- just outside r_{n}\equiv r_{n} there is the maximum height of the Coulomb barrier
  E_{C} = Z_{a} Z_{X} e^{2}/r_{n}.
- inside r_{n} (the nuclear radius of particle X), the potential is
  attractive, and allows for bound states with quantized energy levels
- For 0<E<E_{c}, there are /metastable/ energy level possible (represented
  in the figure by the gray bands). What makes them metastable is also
  what allows nuclear burning: quantum tunnelling through the Coulomb
  barrier.

#+CAPTION: Top: Interaction potential between a and X considering nuclear and electromagnetic interactions. Bottom: qualitative sketch of the wave function of particle a in the potential caused by particle X. The region between r_{n} and r_{c} is the "classically forbidden region". The wavefunction needs to be smooth at both those radii and the solution where quantum tunnelling succeeds allow for a large amplitude of the wave function inside r<r_{n}.

*** Impossibility of nuclear reactions without QM
Without QM, for a nuclear reaction to happen (assuming Bohr's
approximation), the two charged particles would need a relative energy
at infinity higher than the maximum of the Coulomb barrier, so that r_{c}
\leq r_{n}. Assuming the energy is just coming from the thermal energy of
the gas:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
E \simeq k_{B} T \geq E_{C} = \frac{Z_{a}Z_{X}e^{2}}{r_{n}} \geq \frac{e^{2}}{r_{0}} \Rightarrow T\geq \frac{e^{2}}{r_{0} k_{B}} \simeq 10^{10} \ \mathrm{K} \ \ ,

where we assume Z_{a} = Z_{x} = A = 1 to minimize the Coulomb barier, so
r_{n} \equiv r_{0} = 1.3 \times 10^{-13} cm. The temperature threshold we have derived
is much larger than the mean temperature in the Sun as estimated with
the Virial theorem. It is also much larger than the central
temperature of the Sun which one could estimate assuming \langle T \rangle -
T_{surf,\odot} \sim T_{center,\odot} - \langle T \rangle. /The Sun is not hot
enough to have nuclear energy generation without QM/.

*N.B.:* In a nuclear fusion experiment energies E\geq E_{C} are reached,
however, the beams are /not/ in thermal equilibrium. The key point is
/laboratory nuclear physics experiment occur at much higher energies
than nuclear reactions in stars/.

*** Charged particles nuclear reaction tunneling through the Coulomb barrier
The piece of puzzle that allows for charged particles nuclear
reactions in stars is the QM /tunnel effect/, which was studied in the
context of the C^{\star} \rightarrow Y+b decay by Gamow.

*N.B.:* the /tunnel effect/ is a purely wave mechanics phenomenon that has
to do with constructive interference of waves. The QM element is that
the particles involved here are waves!

From QM, we know that in the "classically forbidden region", where E<V
(so the classical kinetic energy term in E=K+V would be K<0), the wave
function can still be non-zero. To calculate the wave-function \Psi of
particle a in the potential of X, we can make the following ansatz:
 - in the classically allowed region r\geq r_{c} the wave function will have
   the form of a propagating wave with phase dependent on (E-V(r))^{1/2};
 - in the classically allowed region with r\leq r_{n}, we assume the same
   functional form;
 - in the classically forbidden region, we will have a superposition
   of evanescent waves with exponentially decaying amplitude


*N.B.:* The math simplifies significantly using the WKB
approximation, that is writing \Psi = exp(\Phi) and solving for \Phi instead of
\Psi.

By imposing that the wave function \Psi and its derivative \partial_{r}\Psi are
continuous at the boundaries r_{c} and r_{n} one can find solutions that
have a non-zero amplitude /inside/ r_{n}, that is tunneling solutions! The
continuity of \Psi depends on the phase at the boundaries, for specific
values of E it is possible to obtain solutions, these typically
correspond to metastable energy levels of the potential, with energy
E_{metastable} \pm \Delta E and \Delta E \sim h/\tau the "width" in
energy depending on the \tau the half-life of the metastable state. *N.B.:*
the width \Delta E of the levels is set by the uncertainty principle.


These states are metastable because a bound system between a and X
(i.e., C^{\star}) can result in the tunneling of a out of the potential
of X (the decay C^{\star} \rightarrow a+X).

Therefore, the nuclear reaction rates are going to be extremely
sensitive to the relative energy of a and X: if this relative energy E
hits a /resonance/ of the compound state C^{\star}, that is if E\sim
E_{metastable}, the wave function of the system has non-zero amplitude
inside the nucleus, and since the probability of finding a within r\le
r_{n} is \prop ||\Psi||^{2}, this means there will be a non-zero probability of
forming the compound nucleus.

In proximity of a resonance the cross section takes the typical shape
of a Lorentzian with width determined by the energy width of the
metastable state C^{\star{:}}

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\sigma_\mathrm{nuc} \propto \frac{1}{(E-E_\mathrm{metastable})^{2} +\left(\frac{\Gamma}{2}\right)^{2}} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

Conversely, for non-resonant reactions, since the thermal energies are
of order of 100 of eV while the nuclear scale is at \sim10MeV we can
neglect the energy dependence of \sigma_{nuc}.

Finally, actually carrying out the calculation give a probability of tunneling

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
P\propto \exp\left(-\int_{r_{n}}^{r_c} \frac{\sqrt{2m_{aX} (V(r) - E)}}{\hbar} dr \right) \equiv P_{0} \exp\left(-\frac{b}{\sqrt{E}}\right) \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
with b = 2\pi Z_{a} Z_{X} e^{2} (m_{aX}/2)^{1/2} / \hbar.

*N.B.:* Nuclear resonances allow stars to work, and for example the
existence of a specific resonance in the nucleus of carbon 12 (Hoyle
state) is what allows helium to burn into carbon and ultimately allows
for life! However, because nuclear physics experiments operate at so
much higher energy than stars, extrapolating to lower relative
energies is complicated and dangerous: it is easy to miss an unknown
resonance that would change significantly the rate.


** Thermonuclear reaction rates
Now that we have discussed how a charged particle nuclear reaction is
possible through quantum tunneling through the Coulomb barrier, to
complete our quest for \varepsilon_{nuc} we need to obtain the rate per unit volume
and time of each possible nuclear reaction.

What brings together the generic nuclei a and X, giving them the
energy E such as the probability of tunneling through the Coulomb
barrier is not negligible is the thermal motion of the gas they
compose: this is why we talk about /thermonuclear/ reactions in a star
(and why the energy scale for these reactions is much lower than the
energy scale in laboratory experiments).

Once again, to put together an expression for the nuclear reaction
rate we can start from dimensional analysis trying to combine the
available pieces:
- number density of reactants [n_{a}] = [n_{X}] = [L]^{-3
- their relative velocity [v] = [L]/[t] (which is related to their
  relative energy at infinity E which is of the order of the thermal
  energy)
- the cross section for the reaction [\sigma] = [L^{2}] (whose calculation will depend on
  the details of the QM problem outlined above and we know will depend
  on the relative energy of the particles, and thus ultimately their
  relative - thermal - velocity at infinity): \sigma \equiv \sigma(v)
With these ingredients we can make a rate of the number of reactions
X(a,b)Y per unit time and volume with:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
r_{aX} = \sigma(v) v n_{a} n_{X}  \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where we implicitly assumes that a \neq X. However, in a star sometimes
there are reactions among identical particles (for example the weak
reaction p+p\rightarrow D+e^{+} +\nu_{e}). In such cases we should make sure to not
double count particle pairs, so we can write more generally:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
r_{aX} = \frac{1}{1+\delta_{aX}} \sigma(v) v n_{a} n_{X}  \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where \delta_{aX} = 1 \Leftrightarrow a=X. This would be the expression if all particles had
the same relative velocity v. In reality, we know the stellar gas is
pretty close to LTE and thus the distribution in energy of particles
is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and to get the
effective rate of reactions we need to integrate over that.

The relative velocity is v=|v_{a} - v_{X}| (the velocities of the two
species can be different if they have different masses), and
substituting to the number density the integral over the velocities of
the phase space densities n_{i} \rightarrow \int dn_{i}(v) (*N.B.*: we have
already done this many times when deriving the EOS, just in momentum
instead of velocity), our expression for the rate becomes:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
r_{aX} = \frac{1}{1+\delta_{aX}}\int\int dn_{a}(v_{a}) dn_{X}(v_{X}) \sigma(v)v  \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where dn_{i}(v_{i}) are Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, unless we are
considering thermo-nuclear burning in a (partially) degenerate
environment.

:Question:
- *Q*: can you think of stellar situations where there is burning in a
  (partially) degenerate environment?
:end:

We can explicit the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution assuming that the
nuclei are non-relativistic, since their thermal kinetic energy is of
the order of k_{b}T \ll GeV \sim m_{u}/c^{2}, and you can analytically verify
that the product of two Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution keeps the same
functional form by changing variables to express things in the center
of mass frame of the a+X system, yielding:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
r_{aX} = \frac{1}{1+\delta_{aX}}4\pi N_{a}N_{X} \left(\frac{m_{aX}}{2\pi k_{B}T}\right)^{3/2}\int_{0}^{+\infty}\exp\left(-\frac{m_{aX}v^{2}}{k_{B}T}\right) \sigma(v)v v^{2}dv  \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where again m_{aX} = m_{a} m_{X} / (m_{a} + m_{X}) is the reduced mass between a and
X, v their relative velocity, N_{a} and N_{X} are the total number of
particles, and we get a factor of v^{2} from assuming isotropic motion
and using spherical-polar coordinates in velocity space, so d^{3}v = 4\pi
v^{2}dv.

The term in the integral is the average over the distribution of
velocities of \langle\sigma(v)v\rangle, which can be interpreted as /the probability
per unit volume that two nuclei will react/.

*N.B.:* this does /not/ depend on the density \rho!

Often, this average quantity is approximated as a powerlaw from the
known value at a certain temperature T_{0}.
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\langle \sigma(v)v \rangle = \langle \sigma(v)v \rangle_{T_{0}}_{} \left(\frac{T}{T_{0}}\right)^{\beta}
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
this is convenient because powerlaw dependencies are intuitive.


Since velocity is not a great quantity to use in QM problems, and we
have seen above that to get nuclear reactions we do need to account
for QM effects, we can rewrite the rate above using that for r\rightarrow +\infty the
relative energy between a and X is purely kinetic (the potential goes
to zero faster than r^{-2} because of electron screening!). Thus
v=(2E/m_{aX})^{1/2}, and we can also use that the cross section \sigma is
proportional to the tunneling probability so \sigma(E)\propto exp(-b/E^{1/2}):
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
r_{aX} \prop \frac{N_{a}N_{X}}{1+\delta_{aX}}\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\frac{1}{k_{B}T}}\int_{0}^{+\infty}\exp\left(-\frac{E}{k_{B}T}-\frac{b}{\sqrt{E}}\right)  \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

We can graph the part within the integral to understand where the rate
is going to peak:

The product of an exponentially decreasing Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution \propto exp(-E) times the exponentially growing tunneling
probability \propto exp(-1/E^{1/2}) will result in a very peak integrand, the
so called Gamow peak: even without nuclear resonances making the cross
section \sigma peak (because E is within the width of a metastable energy
level), the nuclear reaction rate is still very peaked around a
specific energy!

** Heuristic summary
For a generic charged particle thermonuclear reaction X(a,b)Y we can write:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \pi \lambda_{\mathrm{de Broglie}, X}^{2} \times \{ \mathrm{Probability\ of\ Tunneling}\} \times \{\mathrm{Probability\ of\ C^{\star}\ decay\ in\ Y+b}\}\ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where the first term is akin to a geometric cross section using the de
Broglie wavelength of the target nucleus X. The product of the two
terms in curly brackets appears because of Bohr's approximation (so
that the two probabilities are independent of each other). Since \lambda_{de
Broglie, X} = h/p = h/E^{1/2} \Rightarrow \lambda_{de Broglie, X}^{2 }\propto
E^{-1} and thus the heuristic expression above gives:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\sigma \equiv \sigma(E)\propto \frac{1}{E}\exp\left(\frac{-b}{\sqrt{E}}\right)\sigma_{_\mathrm{nuc}}(E) \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where \sigma_{nuc} is the intrinsic cross section that depends on the shape of
the nuclear potential well, and thus the energy levels. This can be
influenced strongly by nuclear resonances (when E \sim energy of a
metastable state of C^{\star{}}).
