In the [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org][previous lecture]] we have developed some idea of the physics
involved in thermonuclear burnings, enough to know that the
thermonuclear reaction rates are going to be strongly peaked functions
of the temperature (because of the Gamow peak and/or nuclear
resonances), let's have a closer look at how this works inside stars.

We have already know from the B/A vs. A curve that the most energy is
released by hydrogen burning into helium (because \alpha particles have
such a high binding energy), and using conservation of charge and
leptonic number we have already written the overall reaction as:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:overall_reaction}
4p \rightarrow ^{4}\mathrm{He}+2e^{+} + 2\nu_{e} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

And we know that a fraction \phi=0.007 of the rest mass of the 4 incoming
protons (i.e., hydrogen positive ions) is converted into energy,
corresponding to a total energy released is Q_{H burn}= 26.5 MeV.

From the overall reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction} we know that the
conversion of hydrogen nuclei into helium requires two weak reactions
to explain the two \nu_{e}, necessary to conserve leptonic number. This is
needed since we need to produce two positrons e^{+} to conserve the
charge.

As you may expect from its name the weak interactions are weak,
meaning the coupling constant is small compared to the coupling
constant for the strong force and electromagnetic force: /weak
interactions are the bottleneck for nuclear processing of matter in stars/.

Moreover, since the nucleus of helium (i.e., \alpha particle) is made of 4
nucleons (2p and 2n), the reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction} seems to
require the encounter of 4 protons (i.e., hydrogen ions) in one point
in space (within r_{nuc}\sim 10^{-13} cm) and with the right relative
energies. The statistical probability of this is vanishingly small,
and that /cannot/ be how the process works in nature, the rate would
effectively be zero. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe][Hans Bethe]] was the person who worked out the way
this could actually happen.

The solution to the prohibitively small probability that nature finds
in stars is to go through intermediate steps instead of doing the
reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction} in one single step, in other words,
to use /thermonuclear reaction chains/.This theorized solution has been
directly confirmed through solar neutrino observations (which also
lead to the development of new neutrino physics), and chemical
observations across astronomical sources.

** Hydrogen burning

*** pp chain
The "pp chain" is the dominant hydrogen burning mode in low mass
stars, like the Sun.

Important thing to notice:
- there are two branches (pp1 and pp2) with different "branching
  ratios" (86% and 14%, respectively) determined by the resonances in
  the daughter nuclei C^{\star}
- the overall reaction produces two neutrinos \nu_{e}, as expected from the
  overall reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction}.
- the first reaction, the weak reaction producing Deuterium (D) is the
  main bottleneck, which can also be understood in terms of the
  nuclear physics: it requires the interaction of two protons (A=1 \Rightarrow
  r_{nuc} = r_{0} = 1.5\times10^{-13} cm) with a high Coulomb barier.
- the \gamma particle produced in certain reactions (i.e. photons needed
  for the conservation of the four-momentum, which are \gamma rays because
  of the 1-10MeV energy scale of nuclear interactions) will quickly
  scatter around off electrons and "thermalize" providing the energy
  to the star
- viceversa, the \nu_{e} leave directly the star (and the Earth is
  constantly bombarded by a flux of \nu_{e} from the Sun!)
- the ^{3}He+^{3}He\rightarrow^{4}He+p+p turns two nuclei into 3, this will
  impact the number of particles per unit baryonic mass (which remains
  \sim6m_{u} at zeroth-order): this will impact the mean molecular \mu
- note from the pp1 cycle we get two 2 protons out at the end as well
  (but 4 went in).

 Fitting the temperature dependence for the overall cycle one obtains
  \varepsilon_{nuc} \propto \langle \sigma(v)v \rangle \propto T^{4}. This is a fairly
  steep powerlaw, therefore one should expect the nuclear burning to
  be /very concentrated/ inside the star in temperature coordinate.

*N.B.* because of the higher and higher Coulomb barriers, the
temperature dependence of \varepsilon_{nuc} gets steeper for heavier nuclear fuel,
so post-helium core burning \varepsilon_{nuc} is more and more concentrated towards
the center, leaving the outer layers unburned and allowing for the so
called "onion layer" structure of stars:

#+CAPTION: Layer structure for an initially 15M_{\odot} star at the end of its nuclear burning lifetime in mass coordinate from [[https://www.as.arizona.edu/\simmrenzo/materials/Thesis/Renzo_MSc_thesis.pdf][Renzo 2015]]. Note the final total mass is /not/ 15M_{\odot} because stars this massive lose mass through radiatively driven winds.

How much burns, that is, how "thick" in mass coordinate is each layer
of the onion, depends on the mixing processes connecting the burning
layer with the fuel reservoir. Each layer of heavier material requires
a higher T to burn (to have a non-zero tunneling probability), so it
is more centralized in mass and radius. However, moving inward \varepsilon_{nuc}
depends more steeply on T, which implies the dT/dr becomes steeper,
and thus we have convection, the extent of which determines where fuel
is depleted. At high masses (M\geq20M_{\odot}), the inner layers start
cooling through neutrinos, which may take away enough energy to
prevent convection from occurring (*N.B.:* convection kicks in only if
needed to transport the energy flux).

The interplay between convection, neutrino cooling, and nuclear
burning ultimately decides the core structure of massive stars at the
end of their life, and whether they form a neutron star or a black
hole, in ways that are still poorly understood (see for example
[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...783...10S/abstract][Sukhbold & Woosley 2014]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240902058L/abstract][Laplace et al. 2024]]).


** Duration of each burning phase

As we have seen (cf. [[./notes-lecture-VirTheo.org][virial theorem lecture]]) stars shine as anything
with a finite temperature does. This eats at their internal thermal
energy, which by the virial theorem is related to their gravitational
potential and drives a decrease in the radius. All this happens (by
definition) at the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale if one assumes constant
luminosity.

However, since the virial theorem implies \langle T \rangle \propto R^{-1} as the star
loses energy at the surface, it's average temperature must increase:
this is often phrased by saying that self-gravitating bodies have a
/negative heat capacity/. It is because of this temperature increase
that nuclear burning must kick in: /stars don't shine because they
burn, viceversa, they burn because they shine/.

Therefore, thermonuclear burning in stars exists only to compensate
the energy losses (to photons at the surface and to neutrinos
throughout the volume that can emit neutrinos), and at equilibrium
L_{nuc} \equiv L making the nuclear burning a [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org::*Energy generation as a self-regulating process][self-regulating process]].

Under the assumption that L_{nuc} = L, we can ask how long does the
consumption of a given fuel take in a star, that is the nuclear
timescale for a given fuel:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\tau_\mathrm{nuc} = \varphi f_\mathrm{burn} \frac{Mc^{2}}{L_{}} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

As we saw in the [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org::*The nuclear timescale][the previous lecture]], f_{burn} is a quantity that
requires computing full stellar evolution models (we now have all the
equations to do so under the classic approximations, it's just a
matter to tell a computer how to solve them!), but clearly 0 <
f_{burn}<1. For a give star of mass M, the important factor here is \phi,
which we can estimate from the nuclear binding energy per nucleon.

Hydrogen burning into helium releases a lot of energy (26.5MeV/4
protons \sim 6.625 MeV/nucleon) because if forms one of the most bound
nuclei in nature, the \alpha particle. This large energy release, means a
large \phi and long nuclear burning timescale. In fact, pretty much for
any star, /hydrogen core burning covers \sim90% of the stellar lifetime/.
This independently on whether H burning happens through the pp chain
or CNO cycle. For this reason, while the "main sequence" is
technically an observationally defined feature on the color-magnitude
diagram, it is common to refer to hydrogen core burning models as
"main sequence" models: observed stars on the observed main sequence
are so numerous because they are in the by far longest phase of their
evolution, during which they are burning hydrogen in their core.

The burning of Helium into a mixture of carbon and oxygen is the
second most energetic burning: this is the reason why it occurs once a
star runs out of hydrogen fuel. Again, we get a high \phi factor because
helium fusion climbs the B/A vs. A curve, and helium core burning
usually last 10% of the hydrogen core burning time (\phi_{He}_{} \simeq 0.1
\phi_{H}), so /hydrogen and helium core burning together cover 99% of the
stellar lifetime/.

All the other burning phases /collectively/ are only \leq 1% of a star
lifetime! Although they are /crucial/ for the chemical evolution of the b
Universe, they are only a "blip" in the lifetime of the stars, because
B/A vs. A roughly flattens (and f_{burn} also decreases): each subsequent
fuel produces less and less energy per barion, thus the burning must
be faster and faster to compensate for the surface losses (and L also
typically increases). This also makes these phases more rare to
observe and thus harder to study.

For instance, the timescale for the last possible burning phase in
massive stars, silicon \rightarrow iron only lasts order of /days/.
