In the [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org][previous lecture]] we have developed some idea of the physics
involved in thermonuclear burnings, enough to know that the
thermonuclear reaction rates are going to be strongly peaked functions
of the temperature (because of the Gamow peak and/or nuclear
resonances), let's have a closer look at how this works inside stars.

We have already know from the B/A vs. A curve that the most energy is
released by hydrogen burning into helium (because \alpha particles have
such a high binding energy), and using conservation of charge and
leptonic number we have already written the overall reaction as:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:overall_reaction}
4p \rightarrow ^{4}\mathrm{He}+2e^{+} + 2\nu_{e} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

And we know that a fraction \phi=0.007 of the rest mass of the 4 incoming
protons (i.e., hydrogen positive ions) is converted into energy,
corresponding to a total energy released is Q_{H burn}= 26.5 MeV.

From the overall reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction} we know that the
conversion of hydrogen nuclei into helium requires two weak reactions
to explain the two \nu_{e}, necessary to conserve leptonic number. This is
needed since we need to produce two positrons e^{+} to conserve the
charge.

As you may expect from its name the weak interactions are weak,
meaning the coupling constant is small compared to the coupling
constant for the strong force and electromagnetic force: /weak
interactions are the bottleneck for nuclear processing of matter in stars/.

Moreover, since the nucleus of helium (i.e., \alpha particle) is made of 4
nucleons (2p and 2n), the reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction} seems to
require the encounter of 4 protons (i.e., hydrogen ions) in one point
in space (within r_{nuc}\sim 10^{-13} cm) and with the right relative
energies. The statistical probability of this is vanishingly small,
and that /cannot/ be how the process works in nature, the rate would
effectively be zero. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe][Hans Bethe]] was the person who worked out the way
this could actually happen.

The solution to the prohibitively small probability that nature finds
in stars is to go through intermediate steps instead of doing the
reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction} in one single step, in other words,
to use /thermonuclear reaction chains/.This theorized solution has been
directly confirmed through solar neutrino observations (which also
lead to the development of new neutrino physics), and chemical
observations across astronomical sources.

** pp chain
The "pp chain" is the dominant hydrogen burning mode in low mass
stars, like the Sun.
