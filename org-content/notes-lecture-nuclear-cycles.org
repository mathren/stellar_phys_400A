** Heuristic summary and S-factor
In the [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org][previous lecture]] we have developed some idea of the physics
involved in thermonuclear reactions. We can have a heuristic
derivation of the main results we obtained for a generic charged particle
reaction X(a,b)Y by writing the cross section for the reaction as:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \pi \lambda_{X}^{2} \times \{ \mathrm{Probability\ of\ Tunneling}\} \times \{\mathrm{Probability\ of\ C^{\star}\ decay\ in\ Y+b}\}\ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where the first term is akin to a geometric cross section using the de
Broglie wavelength of the target nucleus X. The product of the two
terms in curly brackets appears because of Bohr's approximation (so
that the two probabilities are independent of each other). Since \lambda_{X} = h/p = h/E^{1/2} \Rightarrow \lambda_{X}^{2 }\propto
E^{-1} and thus:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:heuristic_summary}
\sigma \equiv \sigma(E)\propto \frac{1}{E}\exp\left(\frac{-b}{\sqrt{E}}\right)S(E) \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

where S(E) is the so called "/astrophysical S-factor/" that contains the
intrinsic cross section that depends on the shape of the nuclear
potential well. This can be influenced strongly by nuclear resonances
(when E \sim energy of a metastable state of C^{\star{}}).

In practice, often one relies on laboratory measurements (at high E\gg
thermal energy in stars), and extrapolation to low energies to obtain
S(E), which is a risky business precisely because of the resonances!
In absence of resonances though, one expects S(E) to be only slowly
varying (unlike \sigma(E) which depends on the Coulomb penetration
probability).

To obtain a /thermo/-nuclear reaction rate, the cross section above has
to be averaged over a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The product
between the tunneling probability and the exponential factor of the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution produces the "Gamow peak" making
thermonuclear reaction rates strongly peaked functions of the
temperature whether there are resonances (included in the
astrophysical factor S(E)) or not.

We have already know from the B/A vs. A curve that the most energy is
released by hydrogen burning into helium (because \alpha particles have
such a high binding energy), and using conservation of charge and
leptonic number we have already written the overall reaction as:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:overall_reaction}
4p \rightarrow ^{4}\mathrm{He}+2e^{+} + 2\nu_{e} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

And we know that a fraction \phi=0.007 of the rest mass of the 4 incoming
protons (i.e., hydrogen positive ions) is converted into energy,
corresponding to a total energy released is Q_{H burn}= 26.5 MeV.

From the overall reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction} we know that the
conversion of hydrogen nuclei into helium requires two weak reactions
to explain the two \nu_{e}, necessary to conserve leptonic number. This is
needed since we need to produce two positrons e^{+} to conserve the
charge.

As you may expect from its name the weak interactions are weak,
meaning the coupling constant is small compared to the coupling
constant for the strong force and electromagnetic force: /weak
interactions are the bottleneck for nuclear burning in stars/.

Moreover, since the nucleus of helium (i.e., \alpha particle) is made of 4
nucleons (2p and 2n), the reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction} seems to
require the encounter of 4 protons (i.e., hydrogen ions) in one point
in space (within r_{nuc}\sim 10^{-13} cm) and with the right relative
energies. The statistical probability of this is vanishingly small,
and that /cannot/ be how the process works in nature, the rate would
effectively be zero. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe][Hans Bethe]] was the person who worked out the way
this could actually happen.

The solution to the prohibitively small probability that nature finds
in stars is to go through intermediate steps instead of doing the
reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction} in one single step, in other words,
to use /thermonuclear reaction chains/.This theorized solution has been
directly confirmed through solar neutrino observations (which also
lead to the development of new neutrino physics), and chemical
observations across astronomical sources.

*N.B.:* all the reactions we will write down today can be inferred using
the conservation law for baryonic number, leptonic number, and
four-momentum (i.e., energy and momentum).

** Hydrogen burning

*** pp chain
The "pp chain" is the dominant hydrogen burning mode in low mass
stars, like the Sun:

#+CAPTION: Schematic representation of the pp chain. The right branch is the so called pp1 chain, the rarer left branch is the so called pp2 chain.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/pp_cycle.png]]


Important thing to notice:
- there are two branches (pp1 and pp2) with different "branching
  ratios" (86% and 14%, respectively) determined by the resonances in
  the daughter nuclei C^{\star}
- the overall reaction produces two neutrinos \nu_{e}, as expected from the
  overall reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction}.
- the first reaction, the weak reaction producing Deuterium (D) is the
  main bottleneck, which can also be understood in terms of the
  nuclear physics: it requires the interaction of two protons (A=1 \Rightarrow
  r_{nuc} = r_{0} = 1.5\times10^{-13} cm) with a high Coulomb barier.
- the \gamma particle produced in certain reactions (i.e. photons needed
  for the conservation of the four-momentum, which are \gamma rays because
  of the 1-10MeV energy scale of nuclear interactions) will quickly
  scatter around off electrons and "thermalize" providing the energy
  to the star
- viceversa, the \nu_{e} leave directly the star (and the Earth is
  constantly bombarded by a flux of \nu_{e} from the Sun!)
- the ^{3}He+^{3}He\rightarrow^{4}He+p+p turns two nuclei into 3, this will
  impact the number of particles per unit baryonic mass (which remains
  \sim6m_{u} at zeroth-order): this will impact the mean molecular \mu
- note from the pp1 cycle we get two 2 protons out at the end as well
  (but 4 went in).

Fitting the temperature dependence for the overall cycle one obtains
\varepsilon_{nuc} \propto \langle \sigma(v)v \rangle \propto T^{4}. This is a fairly
steep powerlaw, therefore one should expect the nuclear burning to
be /very concentrated/ inside the star in temperature coordinate.

*** CN-NO bi-cycle
When the luminosity of a star is high (recall for a fully radiative
star L\propto M^{x}\mu^{4} with x \equiv x(M)\ge0), the bottleneck for the
reaction p+p\rightarrow D+e^{+} +\nu_{e} prevents the stars from reaching L=L_{nuc}
through the pp chain and another mechanism to achieve the overall
reaction \ref{eq:overall_reaction} is needed.

This occurs for stars with total mass M\ge1.2M_{\odot} and actually, to some, this is what
/defines/ a star to be massive. The exact threshold value depends on
modeling choices. For masses larger than this, hydrogen core burning occurs
through the CN-NO bi-cycle, where the "trick" to bypass the bottleneck
of the weak reaction in the pp chain is to use metal ions as catalysts
for the reactions.

#+CAPTION: Schematic representation of the CN-NO bi cycle.
[[./images/CN-NO.png]]


Important things to notice:
- C, N, and O are not /destroyed/ here, they just act as nuclear
  catalyst. Protons momentarily "stick" to them, and then \alpha particles
  are produced re-making the original C, N, and O
- the bottleneck of the weak reactions is now bypassed by forming an
  unstable isotope of a metal and having that decay: in a sense
  massive stars "hack" nuclear physics to make the weak reaction not
  happen in an isolated proton+proton reaction which is hard, but
  within nuclei
- CN + NO = CNO
- ^{14}N is a stable isotope (N=Z=A/2), and the ^{14}N+p reaction is
  the bottleneck of the bi-cycle: since at equilibrium all these
  reactions occur at the same rate set by the slowest reaction, this
  means that C and O are converted into ^{14}N in the core of massive
  stars.

Because of the higher Coulomb barriers involved one can expect a
steeper temperature dependence of this hydrogen burning mode, and in
fact one finds for the CNO cycle \varepsilon_{nuc} \propto T^{16}.

This very steep energy dependence produces a very large temperature
gradient in the core of massive stars (by releasing energy in a very
small region in mass): the cores of stars burning through the CNO
cycle are *convective*.

*N.B.:* This is also how hydrogen burns in a shell or at the surface of
a white dwarf during a nova explosion. However, in the latter case,
the burning is not caused by the hydrostatic structure of the star
(i.e., by the virial theorem)! In that case you can have the "hot CNO"
cycle, where reaction rates do /not/ need to wait for \beta-decays to occur.
This is a general feature of explosive burning: in that case we don't
need to wait for the slowest nuclear reaction in the cycle, as the
high temperatures can allow to bypass Coulomb barriers more easily.

:Question:
- *Q*: How did population III stars do this? This is the topic of the [[./honors.org::*Main sequence burning in massive population III
  stars][honors project]]!
:end:

** Helium burning
Once hydrogen fuel runs out in the core of a star (i.e., for mass
coordinate m \le f_{burn} M_{tot}), the next fuel to burn is going to be
helium. First of all, this is always available (since it was produced
in the Big Bang), and secondly, it's the energetically second-best
fuel in terms of energy release.

However, there is a nuclear physics problem: no stable nucleus with
A=5 and A=8 and the few A=7 produced during hydrogen burning are very
fragile and easy to break, so they don't survive the hydrogen burning
phase either. So how can one do thermonuclear reactions of helium?

This was solved by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle][Fred Hoyle]], who predicted that there would be a
metastable state of carbon (as a C^{\star} compound nucleus in Bohr's
approximation) that would allow to consume helium.

*** "Triple \alpha" reaction
The easiest way to consume helium is through the so called "tiple \alpha
reaction", which is actually a /compound/ reaction with a very short
lived intermediate state (*N.B.:* the probability of 3 alpha particles
to meet in the same place within their nuclear radii because of
thermal motion is negligibly small).

#+begin_latex
$\alpha+\alpha\leftrightarrow^{8}\mathrm{Be}+\gamma$\\
$^{8}\mathrm{Be}+\alpha\rightarrow^{12}\mathrm{C^{\star}}\rightarrow^{12}\mathrm{C}+\gamma$
#+end_latex

As mentioned above, the A=8 nucleus of Beryllium is unstable, and
decays with a half life of \tau_{Be}\sim8\times10^{-17} seconds (*N.B.:* this is
still much longer than the light crossing time \sim2\times10^{-23}sec, so Bohr's
approximation holds!). Therefore, the first reaction can go both ways,
with the beryllium decaying back in two \alpha particles. However, if the
temperature is such that /before/ it can decay, a third \alpha particle will
interact with the beryllium, then one can consume three nuclei of
helium to make a carbon. This requires T\sim10^{8} K \gg T_{center,\odot}\simeq10^{7}
\sim T_{H burn}.


The insight of F. Hoyle was that this would happen, and for this to
happen there /needs/ to be an excited (actually doubly-excited) state of
carbon 12 which was theoretically predicted from the astrophysical
evidence that carbon is the next most abundant element after H and He:
stellar observations were used to correctly predict something on the
structure of nuclei!

*** The nuclear astrophysics "holy grail": $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$
Once some carbon is produced, a new avenue for consuming \alpha particles
opens up, the (in)famous $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction.
This still consumes \alpha, but of course requires overcoming a higher
Coulomb barrier (\propto Z_{c}Z_{He} >Z_{He}^{2}): it becomes convenient for the star
when \alpha particles are getting scarse towards the end of helium core
burning.

This reaction regulates the C/O ratio in stars, and ultimately in the
Universe, clearly something of interest for biology (among other
things). However, its rate is notoriously uncertain, because of the
possible presence of unknown resonances in the compound nucleus.
In fact, here elements are getting sufficiently heavy that the energy
gap between laboratory experiments and the stellar conditions grows
and extrapolation of the astrophysical S-factor gets more and more
uncertain.

This reaction ultimately regulates the composition of the most common
white dwarfs, and also the masses of the most massive black holes, and
it is actively studied in laboratories /and/ in stellar context (see for
example [[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/823/1/46][Fields et al. 2016]] on the structure and composition of white
dwarfs, [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902L..36F/abstract][Farmer et al. 2020]] on black hole masses, [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...945...41S/abstract][Shen et al. 2023]] for
the most recent lab measurements).

** Heavier burning
Once helium fuel is exhausted, helium core burning cannot provide the
energy to compensate for the losses, and the core of the star
contracts further, resulting in an increase in temperature until the
next fuel can ignite.

Because the end of helium core burning occurs through the
$^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction, the composition of the core is now a mixture
of carbon and oxygen (plus some primordial metals there since
formation, which have so far been untouched by nuclear processes,
except maybe conversion of some primordial C and O into N by the CNO
cycle). The next fuel is thus carbon, because it has the lowest
Coulomb barrier.

*N.B.:* Recall that not all stars need to do all burning phases
possible: if electron degeneracy kicks in before T_{center} is high
enough to start reactions, the gravothermal collapse imposed by the
virial theorem interrupts because of the EOS. Since we also know from
the virial theorem that \langle T \rangle \propto M, we know that lower mass stars are
on average cooler and will stop burning earlier.

*** Carbon burning
The carbon+carbon reaction can have several branching ratios with
positive Q values (thus exo-energetic and of interest for the star to
sustain itself):

#+begin_latex
$^{12}\mathrm{C}+^{12}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow^{24}Mg+\gamma$ (Q\sim 13.93MeV)\\
$^{12}\mathrm{C}+^{12}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow^{20}\mathrm{Ne}+\alpha $(Q\sim 4.616MeV)\\
$^{12}\mathrm{C}+^{12}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow^{23}Na+p $(Q\sim 2.238MeV)
#+end_latex

These require T\geq10^{8.5} K, and produce a mixture of Neon, Magnesium (*N.B.:*
an \alpha-nucleus!) and Sodium.

*** Neon ignition and nuclear "magic numbers"
Because of carbon burning, a significant amount of neon is produced.
Although neon has A=20 and Z=10 so it is heavier and more charged than
oxygen (produced by the end of helium core burning and still untouched
by carbon burning at this point), it will ignite before.

The reason has to do with a nuclear physics property: one can make a
direct analogy between nuclei and atoms, and like atoms of "noble
gases" which have electrons in all their shells are very stable and
don't like to do chemical interactions with other atoms/molecules,
nuclei with nucleons filling all their shells are also particularly
stable. This gives the nuclear "magic numbers" of nucleons that are
particularly stable: 2, 8, 20, 28, 52 (and there are higher numbers
theoretically predicted from nuclear structure calculations).

$^{16}\mathrm{O}$ has Z=8 and N=8, so it is a "double magic nucleus", that from
the nuclear interaction perspective is like a noble gas from the
chemical perspective: it is extremely stable and does not want to
interact.

Therefore, the gravothermal collapse reaches temperatures sufficient
to /photodisintegrate/ the heavier (but not magic) nucleus of $^{20}\mathrm{Ne}$
before oxygen burns.

However, the fact that the photodisintegration of neon is easy
relative to oxygen ignition is a direct consequence that the nucleus
of neon is not extremely bound and its burning does not release very
much energy, resulting in a brief phase of stellar evolution only.

*** Oxygen
As T further increases because of the oxygen finally ignites. The
dominant reaction has multiple branching ratios with positive Q value
that produce sulfur and silicon primarily.

*** Silicon core burning
Finally, if a star has reached this point, gravity will compress its
core until it burns all the way to the most bound nucleus
(iron/nickel): stopping somehow the gravothermal collapse at this
point would require extreme fine-tuning.

Post core oxygen burning, the core is made of a mixture of silicon and
sulfur (*N.B.:* this is now very hard to probe directly observationally
because of the very short evolutionary timescales, but it matches well
the nuclear data and abundance patterns in the Universe!).

The next burning phase is typically referred to as "silicon burning",
although it physically proceeds in a slightly different fashion than
all the burning phases we have seen so far.

It typically requires T\sim2-5\times10^{9} K and densities \rho\sim10^{7}-10^{10} g cm^{-3} and
only lasts order of \tau_{nuc, Si}\sim days-weeks since the energy release
per nucleon is /only/ 0.1MeV/nucleon (cf. ~6.6 MeV/nucleon for H
burning!).

At such temperatures, we reach a "quasi statistical equilibrium"
between nuclei: the silicon, sulfur, and other elements (referred to
as "silicon group elements" with A\sim28 and Z\sim14) are photodisintegrated
and re-created at very high and nearly canceling rates:

#+begin_latex
$\gamma + ^{A}Z \rightarrow ^{A'}Z' +{p,n,\alpha}$
#+end_latex

This produces also a variety of light particles (protons, neutrons,
and \alpha particles), which can be captured on the silicon group elements
to form heavier "iron group nuclei" (which are also photodisintegrated
and recreated constantly):
#+begin_latex
$\{p, n,\alpha\} + \{ ^{A}Z,^{A'}Z' \} \rightarrow \{ \mathrm{Fe \ group \ nuclei} \} + \dots$
#+end_latex
Moreover, many ^{A'}Z' nuclei produced by photo-disintegrations and
particles captures are extremely neutron or proton rich, therefore a
lot of weak reaction such as $\beta^{\pm}-$decays and electron captures
happen too (while positron captures are always negligible for stars
with M \leq 40 M_{\odot,} and positrons prefer to annihilate with an
electron producing \gamma rays that quickly thermalize in the plasma see
[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977ApJS...35..145A/abstract][Arnett et al. 1977]]).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/QSE.png]]

This process is computationally very challenging, since there are many
forward and reverse reactions happening at very high rates but
canceling each other out, resulting in a very /stiff/ set of equations
to solve for the evolution of the chemical composition. In this
situation, the truncation errors in the floating point algebra of
computers can easily become problematic. The rates are so high that
the Quasi Statistical Equilibrium (QSE) regime is achieved: two
distinct groups of isotopes in equilibrium are formed around silicon
and iron and only few reactions linking the two groups are out of
balance with their reverse.

Within each ``equilibrium group'', the abundances of each isotope stay
roughly constant, because production and destruction reactions
involving only isotopes of that group cancel out almost exactly. This
means that within each group, Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium (NSE) is
reached, an assumption that can simplify the calculations that we will
use in atomic (rather than nuclear) context [[./notes-lecture-radTrans.org][later]].

Note however that /weak reaction are never balanced by their reverse
reaction/: the cross section for neutrino captures is too small at
this stage. Strong and electromagnetic mediated nuclear reactions need
to compensate also the weak reactions for the isotopes that can
\beta-decay or capture electrons. Therefore this is not a true
statistical equilibrium regime, and the ``principle of detailed
balance'' does not hold strictly. Some widely used stellar evolution
codes therefore do not rely on the approximation of ``quasi
equilibrium'' and instead calculate directly all the reactions.

This process ends with the formation of an Iron core, made of nuclei
at the maximum of the B/A vs. A curve that the star cannot burn to
sustain itself: at this point gravity wins, and we get a core-collapse
event resulting in (possibly) a supernova explosion and the formation
of a neutron star or a black hole, which we will discuss in a [[./notes-lecture-end-massive-stars-and-SNe.org][future
lecture]].

* Summary of energy scaling

#+CAPTION: \varepsilon_{nuc} \equiv \varepsilon_{nuc}(T) dependence on a log-log plot for the burning cycles that cover \ge99% of the stellar lifetime (H and He core burning). From [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nuclear_energy_generation.svg][wikipedia]].
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/Nuclear_energy_generation.png]]

*N.B.:* The central temperature of the Sun correspond to the higher
range where the pp chain dominates the energy production. This means
that in the Sun we expect some CNO burning at a sub-dominant level,
and indeed \nu_{e} from the decay of ^{13}N have been experimentally
detected (one can recognize them from their spectrum), see [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2934-0][Borexino
collaboration 2020]].

Because of the higher and higher Coulomb barriers, the temperature
dependence of \varepsilon_{nuc} gets steeper for heavier nuclear fuel, so
post-helium core burning \varepsilon_{nuc} is more and more concentrated towards
the center, leaving the outer layers unburned and allowing for the so
called "onion layer" structure of stars:

#+CAPTION: Layer structure for an initially 15M_{\odot} star at the end of its nuclear burning lifetime in mass coordinate from [[https://www.as.arizona.edu/\simmrenzo/materials/Thesis/Renzo_MSc_thesis.pdf][Renzo 2015]]. Note the final total mass is /not/ 15M_{\odot} because stars this massive lose mass through radiatively driven winds.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/onion.png]]

How much burns, that is, how "thick" in mass coordinate is each layer
of the onion, depends on the mixing processes connecting the burning
layer with the fuel reservoir. At the outer edge of each shell of the
"onion" there can be (and typically there is) an off-center burning
region, so called "shell burning". The outer layer of the He
core/inner layer of the H envelope (the exact boundary depends on the
definition one adopts) is sufficiently hot to burn the remaining fuel
there, and this burning sustains the outer layer above it. Because of
the presence of burning shells, the core burning only needs to sustain
the matter inside the shell, which slightly complicates the
/gravothermal/ argument we have used.

Each layer of heavier material requires
a higher T to burn (to have a non-zero tunneling probability), so it
is more centralized in mass and radius. However, moving inward \varepsilon_{nuc}
depends more steeply on T, which implies the dT/dr becomes steeper,
and thus we have convection, the extent of which determines where fuel
is depleted. At high masses (M\geq20M_{\odot}), the inner layers start
cooling through neutrinos, which may take away enough energy to
prevent convection from occurring (*N.B.:* convection kicks in only if
needed to transport the energy flux).

The interplay between convection, neutrino cooling, and nuclear
burning ultimately decides the core structure of massive stars at the
end of their life, and whether they form a neutron star or a black
hole, in ways that are still poorly understood (see for example
[[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...783...10S/abstract][Sukhbold & Woosley 2014]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240902058L/abstract][Laplace et al. 2024]]).

* Duration of each burning phase

As we have seen (cf. [[./notes-lecture-VirTheo.org][virial theorem lecture]]) stars shine as anything
with a finite temperature does. This eats at their internal thermal
energy, which by the virial theorem is related to their gravitational
potential and drives a decrease in the radius. All this happens (by
definition) at the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale if one assumes constant
luminosity.

However, since the virial theorem implies \langle T \rangle \propto R^{-1} as the star
loses energy at the surface, it's average temperature must increase:
this is often phrased by saying that self-gravitating bodies have a
/negative heat capacity/. It is because of this temperature increase
that nuclear burning must kick in: /stars don't shine because they
burn, viceversa, they burn because they shine/.

Therefore, thermonuclear burning in stars exists only to compensate
the energy losses (to photons at the surface and to neutrinos
throughout the volume that can emit neutrinos), and at equilibrium
L_{nuc} \equiv L making the nuclear burning a [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org::*Energy generation as a self-regulating process][self-regulating process]].

Under the assumption that L_{nuc} = L, we can ask how long does the
consumption of a given fuel take in a star, that is the nuclear
timescale for a given fuel:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\tau_\mathrm{nuc} = \varphi f_\mathrm{burn} \frac{Mc^{2}}{L_{}} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

As we saw in the [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org::*The nuclear timescale][the previous lecture]], f_{burn} is a quantity that
requires computing full stellar evolution models (we now have all the
equations to do so under the classic approximations, it's just a
matter to tell a computer how to solve them!), but clearly 0 <
f_{burn}<1. For a give star of mass M, the important factor here is \phi,
which we can estimate from the nuclear binding energy per nucleon.

Hydrogen burning into helium releases a lot of energy (26.5MeV/4
protons \sim 6.625 MeV/nucleon) because if forms one of the most bound
nuclei in nature, the \alpha particle. This large energy release, means a
large \phi and long nuclear burning timescale. In fact, pretty much for
any star, /hydrogen core burning covers \sim90% of the stellar lifetime/.
This independently on whether H burning happens through the pp chain
or CNO cycle. For this reason, while the "main sequence" is
technically an observationally defined feature on the color-magnitude
diagram, it is common to refer to hydrogen core burning models as
"main sequence" models: observed stars on the observed main sequence
are so numerous because they are in the by far longest phase of their
evolution, during which they are burning hydrogen in their core.

The burning of Helium into a mixture of carbon and oxygen is the
second most energetic burning: this is the reason why it occurs once a
star runs out of hydrogen fuel. Again, we get a high \phi factor because
helium fusion climbs the B/A vs. A curve, and helium core burning
usually last 10% of the hydrogen core burning time (\phi_{He}_{} \simeq 0.1
\phi_{H}), so /hydrogen and helium core burning together cover 99% of the
stellar lifetime/.

All the other burning phases /collectively/ are only \leq 1% of a star
lifetime! Although they are /crucial/ for the chemical evolution of the b
Universe, they are only a "blip" in the lifetime of the stars, because
B/A vs. A roughly flattens (and f_{burn} also decreases): each subsequent
fuel produces less and less energy per barion, thus the burning must
be faster and faster to compensate for the surface losses (and L also
typically increases). This also makes these phases more rare to
observe and thus harder to study.

For instance, the timescale for the last possible burning phase in
massive stars, silicon \rightarrow iron only lasts order of /days/.

* Homework
- Calculate the Sun's mass loss rate due to the nuclear burning of 4
  protons into helium.
- Using =MESA-web=, which contains tabulated data for nuclear reactions
  from experiments, calculate the evolution until the end of iron core
  burning of a massive (M>15M_{\odot})_{}_{} star and use the
  =trimmed_history.data= output to:
  1. determine the typical composition of the core at various
     evolutionary phases and explain it in terms of the experimentally
     derived properties of nuclei (*hint*: use the variables =center_*= to
     plot the mass fraction of abundances as a function of time)
  2. estimate the duration of each core burning phase.

  *N.B.:* You can also use the "movie" of the evolution of the star
  produced by =MESA-web= for you.

   *N.B.:* The values you will find may differ from the table above:
  that's ok! The simulation output depends on many physics assumptions
  which are probably not the same in the models =MESA-web= runs and
  those I quoted, this actually gives you an idea of /systematic/ errors
  in the numerical computations

  *N.B.:* Computing the evolution of massive stars through /all/ the
  burning phases is numerically challenging (and the stiffness of the
  nuclear reactions rate dependence on T is a big part of the
  challenge), therefore it is possible that your =MESA-web= model may
  not finish the run. The file =input.txt= has a string at the end
  telling you if the model was successful or not. If your model is not
  and you can't get a successful model by the deadline by fiddling
  with the input parameters, mention which input you used (listed in
  that file) and list the composition and typical duration up to where
  your model evolved.

  *Hint*: I have tried with the following settings and got a model to
  form an iron core, that is successfully burn through all the viable
  nuclear fuel:
    - Initial Mass: 20M_{\odot} (solar mass)
    - Burning Modifiers: =none=
    - Nuclear Reaction Network: =approx21=
    - Sampled Nuclear Reaction: =none=
    - Initial Metallicity: 0.02
    - Mixing Length Alpha: 2.0
    - Mixing Length Theory Implementation: Cox (this is an algorithmic
      formulation of MLT)
    - Convective Overshoot f: 0.000
    - Convective Overshoot f0: 0
    - Semi-Convection Alpha: 0
    - Thermohaline Alpha: 0
    - Thermohaline Mixing Implementation: Kippenhahn
    - Boundary Mixing: =pred= = =.false.= / =predms= = =.true.= / =cpm= =
      =.false.= (the default)
    - Red Giant Branch Wind Scheme: Dutch (this specifies stellar winds)
    - RGB Wind Scaling Factor: 0.8
    - Asymptotic Giant Branch Wind Scheme: Dutch
    - AGB Wind Scaling Factor: 0.8
