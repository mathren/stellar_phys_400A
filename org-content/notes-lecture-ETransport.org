Kippenhan & Weigert's book.

** Summary of where we are

*Mass conservation:*
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mass_cont}
dm = 4\pi \rho r^{2} dr \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

*Hydrostatic equilibrium:*
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HSE}
\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{Gm}{r^{2}}\rho \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex


*Equation of state:*
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EOS}
P \equiv P(\rho, \mu, T) \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

These three equations have as variables m \equiv m(r) (or equivalently r\equiv
r(m)), P, \rho, and T. By adding an EOS to relate P and \rho (and the
composition of the star which enters in the mean molecular weight \mu),
in the general case, we have also added a new variable T, so the
system is not close again, and we need to look for one more equation
to be able to solve it!

** Energy flow in stars

To find another equation, we can consider how energy flows in a star.
We have already seen that the surface temperature (e.g., of the Sun),
and the average temperature (estimated using the [[file:notes-lecture-VirTheo.org::+title: 400A - Virial theorem][virial theorem]]) are
/not/ the same, so we know that the star is /not/ in global thermal
equilibrium. We also know, from similar arguments, that the average
temperature is higher than the surface temperature, so there should be
an energy flow from the interior outwards.

This energy flow can occur in two forms in a star:
1. *Diffusion*: thermal energy can be moved by the random motion of
   particles. This is often the dominant energy transport mechanism in
   a star -- unless for some reason it is insufficient. The diffusion
   of energy can be:
   - *Radiative*, if the particles carrying the energy through their
     random motion are photons
   - *Conductive*: if it is the thermal motion of gas particles
     (typically electrons, unless you are in a neutron star) that
     carries the energy
2. *Convection*: in this case thermal energy is transported by bulk
   motion of matter. This occurs as a *thermal* instability if the other
   means of energy transport are insufficient to carry the energy flux
   required by the local stellar structure, and it will be the topic
   of a [[https://www.as.arizona.edu/~mrenzo/materials/Convection.pdf][future lecture]].

The next /two/ stellar structure equations to add to our system will
come from combining all of these together.

** Diffusion processes
In general, the "diffusion approximation" is useful to describe the
net flux of "something" when the average path of the carrier of said
"something" is small compared to the lengthscale over which the
"something" is transported.

In this approximation, the net flux of this "something" is related to
the density of "something" by

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diff}
\mathbb{J} = - D\nabla n \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where J is the flux (which is in general a vector quantity), D is the
so called "diffusion coefficient", and \nabla n is the gradient of the
volumetric density of the "something" we are considering. The negative
sign appears because the flux is opposite to the gradient ("something"
flows from where there is a lot to where there is less!). By
dimensional analysis, regardless of what "something" is (and what are
its dimensions), you can see that:
- [J] = [something]/(L^{2}t) with L length dimension and t time;
- [\nabla] \equiv [d/dx] = 1/L;
- [n] = [something]/L^{3}

Therefore, the diffusion coefficient has the dimensions of [D] = L^{2}/t
\equiv v \times L, so we can expect D to be proportional to the average velocity
of the "something" that is diffusing times the length scale for the
motion of this something (which by hypothesis is small compared to the
length scale over which we want to study the motion of this
"something"). In fact this is almost correct!

To get the correct pre-factor, let's say "something" are particles
moving in 3 dimensions and focus on one direction, say z. If all these
particles have a mean free path \ell and an average velocity v, then the
number that crosses a given coordinate z with a positive \delta z as a
function of time is:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dt}(z) =\frac{1}{2} n \frac{1}{3}v \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where the first 1/2 factor comes from the fact that their motion is
random, so half the particles have negative \delta z and half have a
positive one, and we just want to count the latter, and the factor of
1/3 in front of their average velocity comes from the fact that the
motion is isotropic (see [[file:notes-lecture-EOS1.org::*Ideal gas][derivation of the pressure]]).

If there is a gradient \partial n /\partial z of particles along the z direction,
the particles moving with positive \delta z  come from n(z-\ell)
while those moving with the negative \delta z  come from n(z+\ell), so the net
flux across z is

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
J = \frac{dN}{dt}(z-\ell) -\frac{dN}{dt}(z+\ell) = \frac{1}{6}v\left(n(z-\ell)-n(z+\ell)\right)=\frac{1}{6}v\left(-2\ell\frac{\partial n}{\partial z}\right) = -\frac{1}{3}v\ell\frac{\partial n}{\partial z} \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

Eq. \ref{eq:diff} is the generalization in 3 dimensions of the above,
where \nabla = (\partial_{x}, \partial_{y}, \partial_{z}) for Cartesian coordinates, and
D=v\ell/3.
