*Materials*: chapter 1 of Onno Pols' lecture notes, Sec. 30.2 of
Kippehahn book, Sec. 8.2 of Ostie & Carroll book, [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1914PA.....22..331R][Russell 1914]]

* How can we study things that evolve too slow for us to see?
** Population studies
We can look at large samples and try to infer lifetimes from how many
individual stars we find in each subset of the population.

This is like studying the life of trees not by sitting there and
waiting for the seed to grow, but instead by looking at how many trees
are in each stage of life in a forest.

Classically, we divide stars in populations based on their chemical
composition and dynamical status (w.r.t. the Galactic potential)

 - *Population I*: these are relatively high metallicity (\simeq Z_{\odot}\simeq
   0.0146) stars in the galactic disk. They are all dynamically cold
   (meaning their orbital velocity follows closely the Keplerian
   rotation curve around the Galactic center, with very small
   deviations from this). These are forming from gas enriched in
   metals by previous generations of stars.
 - *Population II*: these are typically stars in the Galactic halo with
   lower metallicity, but higher dynamical temperature, meaning their
   orbit are not following the Galactic disk Keplerian motion. In
   fact, they are not in the Galactic disk by definition, but rather
   form a quasi-spherical halo in the Galaxy.

The distinction between these two population dates to [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1944ApJ...100..137B/abstract][Baade 1944]], and
while it captures some key features of Galactic stellar populations
and the terminology is still in use, it is often possible to be more
precise. Within the Galaxy, it is more common to distinguish stellar
populations based on their dynamical status (which correlates with how
long they have orbited the Galaxy, and thus age) and the abundance of
\alpha elements relative to their iron content (so a more specific
criterion).

One term that instead is still widely present in the literature is:

 - *Population III*: these are /hypothetical/ stars that have not yet been
   observed, formed by metal-free primordial gas composed only of
   hydrogen and helium (and maybe traces of Li and Be) synthesized
   during the Big Bang. These stars should exist, but so far they are
   out of reach for our telescopes. /JWST/ may be able to see the
   integrated light of populations of these primordial stars in some
   very high redshift young galaxy, or maybe their explosions. Strong
   gravitational lensing may also serendipitously reveal these, but
   the [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940L...1W/abstract][record holder]] in distance has redshift z\simeq6.2 (still not high
   enough for Pop III), and it is debated whether the signal is from
   individual stars or aggregated light from multiple sources in a
   cluster. "Third generation" gravitational-wave detectors (planned
   for after LIGO/Virgo and LISA) will be able to detect the signals
   from mergers of the compact object remnants of these stars up to
   redshift \sim20, well beyond the formation of the first stars.

   Because of the quasi-complete lack of metals, Pop III stars are
   expected to *possibly be more massive* on average (so called
   top-heavy initial mass function). Although they have not been
   observed, these are still receiving much theoretical attention
   because of their *potential role during the epoch of reionization*,
   as *parents of the super-massive black holes* in the center of
   Galaxies, and as the *stars that kick started the production of
   chemical elements*.

** Observational color-magnitude diagram

One of the main tools used in stellar physics to study a "population"
of stars (e.g., I and II defined above, or a group of stars selected
because of some criterion, such as location in the sky or others) is
the observational color-magnitude diagram (CMD), which is interpreted
through the lens of theoretical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD).

These two diagrams plot different, but related, quantities on the
axes, and they are so complementary that sometimes the name are used
interchangeably.

#+CAPTION: /Gaia/ [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...616A..10G/abstract][DR2]] (second data release) color magnitude diagram, containing about ~1.3 billion Galactic stars. Only ~4.2 millions are plotted here (because of data quality cuts).

[[./images/Gaia_DR2_HRD_Gaia.png]]

This is an example of an observational color-magnitude diagram from
the second /Gaia/ data release, /Gaia/ DR2 in 2018. The bottom and left
axis are the observational quantities (the CMD),
while the top and right axis show corresponding theoretical quantities
(the HRD).

*N.B.:* /Gaia/ is an ESA space mission measuring with great accuracy and
precision the parallax and proper motion of >1 billion stars in the
Galaxy. This is a very "classical" astrophysics task, but the
precision and size of the datasets from this mission are unprecedented
and are revolutionizing this field (see for example [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024NewAR..9801694E/abstract][El Badry 2024
review]]).

The left y-axis is the *absolute* magnitude in the =G= band of the telescope on
board of the /Gaia/ space-craft.

The bottom x-axis is the "color index", obtained as the difference in flux
between two filters of the /Gaia/ telescope =Bp-Rp=. Other color indexes
can be as difference between the flux in different bands (i.e.,
different photometric filters, e.g. B-V): we'll discuss why in a
second.

Each dot in this plot is a different star, but there are so many (\sim1.8
billions in /Gaia/ DR2), that in the most crowded region what is plotted
is proportional to the square root of the relative density of stars
per unit "pixel" on this plot. So what we are looking at is a /"group
picture" of many different stars, varying in age, composition,
position in the galaxy/, etc.

:Questions:
 - *Q*: where are the cool stars?
 - *Q*: where are the bright stars?
 - *Q*: where would the Sun be on this diagram? (*N.B.:* /Gaia/
   does /not/ look at the Sun, so it is actually not in this plot!) A
   full list of the Sun's absolute and apparent magnitude in many
   filters is available [[https://mips.as.arizona.edu/~cnaw/sun.html][here]].
 - *Q*: Focusing on where most stars are, can you spot any trend?
:end:

Even for such an inhomogeneous sample, the colors show that the vast
majority of stars is sitting along a "line" on this diagram. Since a
line is one dimensional, there should probably be *one* parameter that
determines the position of the star on this diagram. This parameter is
the total mass of the star (though this took several decades to be
established, because it is not something easy to empirically
measure, as we will see in the [[./notes-lecture-BIN.org][next lecture]]).

To see this even more clearly, it may be useful to consider the CMD of
selected group of stars, that we know to be related. The figure below
shows the same dataset from /Gaia/ DR2, but only for stars in two
"clusters". This means that these stars have presumably the same age
(within a few \sim Myr possibly), and they formed from the same molecular
cloud, that is they also all have the same composition. In this case
the apparence of a very tight relation between apparent magnitude and
color index is even more clear.

When selecting only "related" stars, It is much more evident than most are along one line on this diagram (the so-called "Main sequence"), and that this line agrees fairly well across different clusters of similar ages. The few points offset by up to 0.75 mag above the main sequence are unresolved binaries where the light of two stars adds up in the signal.

There are also other sub-groups, like the "Giant Branch" and "White
Dwarfs". We will encounter and explain those later on in the course,
but basically these correspond to more "evolved" stars.

From the density of stars we can also infer where on this diagram
stars spend most of their time! The "main sequence" is surely much
longer lasting than anything else. In fact this corresponds to \sim90% of
the lifetime of stars, for reason that we will explain when we touch
upon nuclear burning. The other phases are much shorter, but stars
still spend some time on the Giant Branch visibly, and then as White
Dwarfs which are in reality "compact remnants" left behind by >95% of
all stars.

** Digression: Spectral types and the letters OBAFGKM(LTY)
To explain the physical meaning of the x axes (bottom, and top), we
need to do a detour and talk about stellar spectra and spectral types.
The latter are one of the many astronomical nomenclature quirks that
exist only for historical reason. Astronomy is a very ancient science
(it's needed to follow the passage of time and decide when planting
things and how to navigate), but it remained separated from physics
(i.e., trying to understand the functioning of the natural world) for
a very long time, with the Aristotelian idea that the "sub-lunar"
world and the super-lunar world were fundamentally different. This
idea was progressively eroded with the "scientific revolution" of the
16^{th}-17^{th} century, and finally astronomy and physics converged into
*astrophysics* with two major breakthroughs:

1. Newton's gravitational law which unified the motion of free falling
   things on Earth with the motion of satellites (Moon around the
   Earth) and Planets
2. The spectroscopic observations of the Sun (and later other stars)
   by Kirchhoff, Bunsen, and Fraunhofer which demonstrated that stars
   are made "of the same stuff" that we find on Earth

Here I want to focus on 2. A spectrum is what one obtains by taking a
source of light and decomposing it in its various frequencies (e.g.,
with a prism, or grating -- think [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon#/media/File:Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png][Pink Floyd's Dark side of the moon
cover]]).

This can be done in any wavelength range, for example, X-ray
spectroscopy is an important tool to study binaries with compact
objects such as neutron stars and black holes. However, for most
stars, since we observe them from ground-based observatories, what is
available is the "optical" spectrum, that is a spectrum in the
wavelength rage that can penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, roughly
between \lambda\simeq300-900 nm.

Kirchhof and Bunsen realized that filtering (white) light through a
rarefied gas before taking its spectrum would produce "absorption
lines", i.e. there would be regions of wavelength where light was
missing, and these could be used to identify which gas was filtering
the light.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Solar spectrum
[[./images/solar-spectrum.jpg]]

Fraunhofer had already taken spectra of the Sun, and it was also
exhibiting "absorption lines". This is because the light filtering out
of the stellar atmosphere is blocked by something (typically these are
ionic/atomic quantum mechanical transition, but this was /not/ known
when they were first observed). This demonstrated that the Sun was
made of the same elements that are visible on Earth.

At this point, people started to classify stars based on the
qualitative morphology of their spectra (which lines are present,
which are more dominant, etc.), and defining qualitative classes A, B,
C,...based on features such as the prominence of Balmer lines of
Hydrogen.

However, it was not yet known why different stars had different
spectra and belong to a certain class. As the number of observations
increased, the classes were reordered and merged, leaving the current
ones listed above after the work by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon][Annie Jump Cannon]] together with
other "Harvard computers", a group of mostly women who analyzed and
made sense of stellar spectra in the Early 20^{th} century.

With the construction of the color-magnitude diagram it was realized
that these qualitative spectral classes were mostly determined by
temperature - from O for the hottest stars to M for the coolest (L and
T are classes introduced later for are classes introduced later for
Brown Dwarves). This is because the temperature of the gas determine
the electron populations in each ion/atom in the stellar atmosphere
and thus how many and which lines can be seen. This is how this
OBAFGKM(LTY) order came to be.

*** A modern view on spectra
The image above of the solar spectrum is pretty, but that is not how
most astrophysicists look at spectra nowadays.

At zeroth-order /approximation/, a star is a black-body with the
characteristic spectrum, that is flux F_{\lambda} as a function of the
wavelength \lambda (or equivalently F_{\nu}\equiv F_{\nu}(\nu) with \nu =
c/\lambda frequency), given by Planck's function:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
F_{\lambda} d\lambda = \frac{2\pi
hc^{2}}{\lambda^{5}}\frac{d\lambda}{e^{hc/\lambda k_{B} T} -1} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck's constant, c the
speed of light, and the flux only depends on the temperature T. One
can also rewrite this in terms of frequency using \nu = c/\lambda (we will
also use the form as a function of \nu later in the course). Integrating
it across all wavelengths one obtain the total flux F \equiv \int F_{\lambda}
d\lambda = \sigma T^{4}, which is the so called /Stefan-Boltzmann law/.

The temperature appearing here is by definition the "effective
temperature", that is the temperature of an ideal black body producing
the same Flux as the star. The black body spectrum produces the
"continuum" of an observed spectrum, and can be thought of the
spectrum of light coming from the outermost layer of the stellar
interior (where the photons are equally like to move in any direction,
as opposed to the stellar atmosphere, see below). In reality, T_{eff} is
an idealization, as should be clear from the definition: the stellar
surface actually does not have a sharp cutoff with a well defined
radius R and temperature T_{eff}. Instead, as one moves outward in the
stellar atmosphere, progressively the gas becomes transparent to
different wavelength \lambda of light: in reality there is a different
radius for each wavelength at which one can observe a star: R \equiv R(\lambda).
This is the topic of the stellar atmosphere, which determines the
outer-boundary conditions we need to study the interior. Throughout
the atmosphere, there will be a location where T = T_{eff}, but there is
nothing physically special occurring there! However, from the interior
point-of-view, it is useful to determine at this idealized location
the outer boundary. We can then specify there the outer boundary
condition to solve the stellar structure equations, which you don't
know yet -- but we will derive and write down during this course.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
[[./images/Blackbody.png]]


Before the continuum produced by the last fully opaque layer of the
star (the outermost layer of the "interior") reaches the telescope, it
has to filter through the stellar atmosphere, which is by definition
the region of the star where there is a net radial flux of photons (as
opposed to the optically thick interior where the distribution of
photons direction is isotropic). It is in this region that absorption
lines can form. Then, there is another filter that matters: the Earth
atmosphere. This can also introduce absorption lines (or even "bands"
when the absorbers are molecules that have many roto-vibration levels
close to each other in energy/frequency/wavelength).

#+CAPTION: Schematic representation of the Sun spectral energy distribution from [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443187865000020?via%3Dihub][Wang et al. 2023]].
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/sun-SED.jpg]]

Typically, data reduction pipelines are used to remove the "black body
slope" due to the underlying continuum and focus only on the
absorption lines. This is usually referred to as "continuum
normalization". An example of the final product for the Sun, with some
of the ions responsible for the visible absorption lines annotated is

#+CAPTION: Example of reduced (portion of the) solar spectrum modified from [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919..100V/abstract][Vejar et al. 2021]]

[[./images/sun-normalized.png]]


Note the wavelength ranges, they are varying widely from plot to plot.
This is partly because different wavelength regions require different
instruments and data reduction techniques (from \gamma rays to radio even
the typical units use vary depending on historic and/or engineering
choices).

*N.B.:* for an element =X= (e.g., H, He, Li, ...,C, N, Si, Fe, F, ...) the
neutral ion is usually indicated with =XI= (so HI is hydrogen with one
electron bound, HeI is a helium atom with its two electrons), the
first ionization stage - meaning one electron is missing -  is
indicated with =XII= (e.g., HII is hydrogen once ionized, that is a
proton without an electron, HeII is a helium ion with two protons, two
neutrons and one electron only, etc...), and so forth. This is the
convention used in the figure above, where SiI is neutral silicon, FeI
is neutral iron, FeII is once ionized iron, etc.

:Question:
- *Q*: Do the units in all these plots match?
:end:

*** Relation with colors
On the /Gaia/ color-magnitude diagram, the color index and both the spectral
types and effective temperature are all on the x-axis (bottom and top,
respectively). How are these related?

Depending on T_{eff}, the maximum flux of a black body (i.e., of the
"continuum") shifts in wavelength, something known as "Wien's
displacement law": \lambda_{max}\prop 1/T, the higher the temperature the
shorter the wavelength of the maximum flux. This in turn means that
the change in T_{eff} translates in a change in the "color" of the star,
because the wavelengths around \lambda_{max} will dominate the perception of
the star (originally for naked eye observations, but this can be
generalized).

This can further be formalized by defining a "color index" as the
difference in flux between different photometric bands. Each band has
a transmission function T(\lambda) which is non-zero over a certain
wavelength range, for example these are the bands from /Gaia/'s
telescope used to make the diagram above:

#+CAPTION:The coloured lines in the figure show the transmission function T(\lambda) of the G, G_{BP} and G_{RP} passbands (green: G; blue: G_{BP}; red: G_{RP}), defining the Gaia EDR3 photometric system. The thin, grey lines show the nominal, pre-launch passbands published in Jordi et al. 2010, used for Gaia DR1. Credits: ESA/Gaia/DPAC, P. Montegriffo, F. De Angeli, M. Bellazzini, E. Pancino, C. Cacciari, D. W. Evans, and CU5/PhotPipe team.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/edr3-passbands
[[./images/GaiaEDR3_ExtPhotSystem.png]]


Thus, each band probes a different wavelength region, and the
difference between two bands probes the slope of the continuum, which
depends only on the effective temperature, since by definition the
shape of the specific flux (per unit wavelength) F_{\lambda} is a black
body distribution.

** Theoretical Hertzsprung-Russel diagram

Let's now get back to the main topic of the lecture, CMD and HRD. The
/Gaia/ color-magnitude diagram on the top shows on the right y-axis and
top x-axis the quantities that typically stellar modelers use,
effective temperature (T_{eff}) on the x-axis and luminosity L on the
y-axis.

The effective temperature is defined as the temperature of a
black-body with the same energy flux as the surface of the star.

By dimensional analysis the integrated flux F=\int F_{\lambda} d\lambda has
units of energy per unit time and area: [E]/[t][A]. We also know that
the stellar luminosity is the amount of energy lost (to photons) per
unit time by the stellar surface. Assuming that the star is a sphere
(a good approximation since these are self-gravitating objects and
gravity is a central force), we can thus write F = L/(stellar surface)
= L/(4\pi R^{2}) and putting this together with Stefan-Boltzmann's law we
finally arrive at L=4\pi R^{2} \sigma T_{eff}^{4}, with R the radius of the star,
\sigma=2\pi^{5} k_{B}^{4}/15c^{2}h^{3} Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

We can then use these same axes to plot not a collection of different
stars at a given point in time, like in the plot from /Gaia/ above, but
instead if we have a model of how a star evolves (which is what we
want to develop in this course), then we can plot one star as a
function of time! This is necessarily a "theoretical" plot: stellar
timescales are typically so long, that one human life is not
sufficient to observe a star moving through such a plot.

The following is an example of HR diagram for a 15M_{\odot} star from
zero age main sequence (roughly when most of its luminosity is
provided by Hydrogen burning in the core) to the onset of
core-collapse and thus the point where it will go supernova.

While all these wiggles may seem arbitrary, one of the objectives of
this course is for you to be able to understand and interpret all of
these, and possibly even produce your own models. Let's not worry too
much about them now.

:Questions:
- *Q*: on this diagram, how does a line for stars at constant radius look like?
:end:

** Putting the two together

We have effectively introduced two types of related diagram:
 - Color-magnitude diagram \sim a "family picture" at a given time of
   many different stars;
 - Theoretical HR diagram \sim a "movie" of the life of one star (or possibly
   few) as it evolves across time.

The important point here is that we can put together on the same (or
tightly related) axes information for an observed population of stars
(e.g., the /Gaia/ CMD above) and for a theoretical model of individual
stars (e.g., the Hertzsprung-Russel evolutionary diagram here). This
mixes two ontologically different elements (observations and models),
but provides a powerful tool to interpret the observations. By
comparing theoretical tracks from computer-simulated stellar models
and observed samples one can infer the physical properties of
the observed stars and the processes determining them.

This video shows how /HST/ observations of the Globular cluster \Omega
Centauri can be sorted in color and magnitude to create...a
color-magnitude diagram, where all the stars end up along an
isochrone (credits NASA/ESA, J. Anderson, R. van der Marel, G. Bacon, M.
Estacion, STScI).

An *isochrone* (from iso = "same" + chronos = "time") is the locus of
points occupied by a population of different stars at a given time.
Typically these are used in analyzing clusters, which are in first
approximation co-eval population of stars with the same composition.
Fitting theoretical isochrones (obtained combining many stellar
models of individual stars) is one of the ways in which one can
determine the age of a cluster.

Note that in the first color-magnitude diagram shown above from /Gaia/
DR2 there are no isochrones: that diagram represents all stars
observed across the Galaxy in /Gaia/ DR2, they have very different ages
from each other, and that's why isochrones there would not be very
informative.

Typically isochrones are used on the color-magnitude diagram, but
nothing forbids one to make isochrones on other planes.

*** Example: 30 Doradus region

The 30 Doradus region (a.k.a. Tarantula Nebula) is a bright massive
star forming region in the LMC that contains \sim1000 massive stars. This
makes it a unique "laboratory" for massive stellar evolution - many of
those stars were not around when dinosaurs were roaming the Earth!

* Homework

** Make your own CMD

*** Aim
Make your own color-magnitude diagram of a selected group of stars.
This is mainly a data-visualization exercise, so try to make your
diagram as informative and useful as possible. Think of a
publication-quality plot (think of the plots shown in class, search in
the literature!), you want it to be good looking for people to want to
use it in their slides, dense in information, and the info should be
layered (the most important things should be more evident, and
secondary, tertiary, etc. information should be progressively less
prominent). You will also need to write a brief paragraph of
description of what is plotted, including the source of data, and the
interpretation.

You will be using real bleeding edge data from the /Gaia/ mission and
widely used stellar models from [[https://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/][MIST]]. MIST stands for "MESA Isochrones
and Stellar Tracks": those are models computed with the same code that
is under the hood in =MESA-web= (although the configuration of the code
is most likely not the same): once again, you are going to be using
real tools used by researcher in the field! Challenges encountered in
this exercise are the kind researchers face in their everyday life!

*N.B.:* If you identify a problem (e.g., with the data, or the plotting)
and cannot find a fix for it, it is ok to describe the problem in your
text for the purpose of this exercise.

*** Deliverables
  - Color-magnitude diagram/Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
  - One paragraph of description (i.e., I want you to /interpret/ your
    plot, not just make it!). Make sure to include the source of the
    data, what one should see in the plot, and what it means. Take
    care in distinguishing what is observational data what is
    theoretical modeling.
  - Script to reproduce the plot (I will not run the script, but you
    should make it an habit to "show your code" - it's only science if
    it is reproducible!). If your script has dependencies on other
    files you wrote, Iwant those too, but mark /clearly/ which file is
    the main one producing the script.

*** Instructions
You will use the latest data release from ESA's /Gaia/ mission, you will
be using a bleeding-edge dataset! These are publicly available in the
[[https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/][Gaia archive]] or any of the [[https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/data-access#PartnerDataCentres][partner data centers]].

  - Skim the /Gaia/ [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...616A..10G/abstract][DR2]] paper on Hertzsprung-Russel diagram: your aim is
    not to understand every detail, but get an idea of how these
    diagrams are constructed from the data and how they can be used as
    tools for stellar physics.
  - Go to [[https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/]] and select the "Search tab"
  - Select the /Gaia/ query you want to make. Feel free to experiment,
    but keep in mind that you will need to briefly explain what it is
    you plot. *Hint 1*: if you are having troubles selecting stars to
    plot based on some (astro)-physical criterion, you can rely on the
    /Gaia/ Catalog of Nearby Stars to plot all the stars within 100pc
    from the Sun described in [[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/05/aa39498-20/aa39498-20.html][this paper]]. The catalog is available for
    download from [[https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/J/A+A/649/A6/][here]] (see the [[https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/J/A+A/649/A6/ReadMe][ReadMe]] for the column headers, you
    probably want to download and plot [[https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/J/A+A/649/A6/table1c.csv][table1c.csv]]). *Hint 2*: you can
    find in papers the queries of the /Gaia/ database for specific
    clusters! For example the cluster NGC6231 can be found using the
    appendix A of [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...655A..31V/abstract][this paper]].
  - Download and, if needed, clean the data (for example removing
    stars that are not part of a cluster based on parallax cuts). Make
    sure you start with a manageable amount -- the full catalog is
    billions of stars, you most likely don't want that.
  - Plot the color-magnitude diagram (suggestion: G-band magnitude on
    the y-axis, BP-RP color on the x-axis, like the plot shown in
    class). *Hint:* be careful whether you have the *absolute* or the
    *relative* magnitude in the data you downloaded, and do the
    appropriate conversion
  - Skim [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...823..102C/abstract][Choi et al. 2016]] describing the MIST project (it's ok if you
    don't understand everything, you will have a much better
    understanding by the end of the semester!).
  - Use the [[https://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/][MIST web interpolator]] to over-plot isochrones on your
    plot. Make sure you obtain and plot files with the correct
    photometry for comparison with /Gaia data./ Note that the file you
    can download has extension =*.iso=, but it is /not/ and =iso= image
    file, just plain text that you can load and plot.
  - *Optional* Use the [[https://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/][MIST web interpolator]] to over-plot evolutionary
    tracks.
  - Make sure to describe what you learn from comparing the model
    tracks with the observations plotted. Do they match? Do they not?
    If so, can you speculate on why?
