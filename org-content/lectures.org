* Lectures topic-by-topic
This is a rough schedule of the topics we will cover. However, we may
not get to all topics, depending on progress throughout the semester
and student interests. The order roughly follows the presentation in
[[https://www.astro.ru.nl/~onnop/][Prof. Onno Pols' notes]], but it is subject to changes as the course progresses.

*N.B.:* The notes provided here are intended to complement, /not/
substitute other sources. You are *strongly encouraged* to consult books
(e.g., Kippenhahn et al. 2012) and Prof. Onno Pols' notes.

** <2025-01-16 Thu> - Intro & orders of magnitude
*Aim*:
 - Discuss [[./syllabus.org][syllabus]] and learning outcomes
 - Go over some basics (magnitudes, parallaxes, solar quantities: M_{\odot}, R_{\odot}, L_{\odot}, stellar lifetimes)
 - Discuss project, show list
 - Discuss expectations and grading rubrics for course and project

[[./notes-lecture-Intro.org][Notes]]

** <2025-01-21 Tue> - Color-magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
*Aim*: Introduce color-magnitude diagrams, theoretical HR diagram, and
how they relate to each other. Review some black body radiation and
the basics of spectral formation to introduce spectral types.

[[./notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.org][Notes]]

** <2025-01-23 Thu> - Binaries and mass measurements
*Aim*: Introduce the concept of binarity of stars as something /not/
exotic. Walk through some classes of binaries based on how we observe
them (astrometric, visual, spectroscopic, eclipsing) and how they can
be used for empirical mass determination.

[[./notes-lecture-BIN.org][Notes]]

** <2025-01-28 Tue> - Hydrostatic equilibrium
*Aim*: Introduce the mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium
equations of stellar evolution. Re-discuss the assumption of spherical
symmetry. Introduce the dynamical timescale(s). Brief introduction to
[[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-submit][MESA-web]].

stars "become hotter as they lose energy".

[[./notes-lecture-VirTheo.org][Notes]]

** <2025-02-06 Thu> - Equation of state 2

equation for non-polytropic models, and local energy conservation
