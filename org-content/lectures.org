* Lectures topic-by-topic
This is a rough schedule of the topics we will cover. However, we may
not get to all topics, depending on progress throughout the semester
and student interest. The order roughly follows the presentation in
[[https://www.astro.ru.nl/~onnop/][Onno Pols notes]].

** <2024-08-27 Tue> Intro & orders of magnitude
*Aim*: Introduce the course, go over some quantities (M_{\odot}, R_{\odot},
L_{\odot}, stellar lifetimes)
[[./notes-lecture-Intro.org][Notes]]

** <2024-08-29 Thu> Color-magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
*Aim*: Introduce color-magnitude diagrams, theoretical HR diagram, and
how they relate to each other. Review some black body radiation and
the basics of spectral formation to introduce spectral types.

[[./notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.org][Notes]]

** <2024-09-03 Tue> Binaries and mass measurements
*Aim*: Introduce binaries as a common thing, list various types of
binaries (astrometric, visual, spectroscopic, eclipsing). Review
Kepler's laws and application to the mass determination in eclipsing
binary systems.

** <2024-09-05 Thu> Hydrostatic equilibrium
*Aim*: Introduce the first stellar structure equation building from
Newton's second law.


** <2024-09-10 Tue> Virial theorem, pressure, estimates

** <2024-09-12 Thu> Equation of state 1

- Polytropic Equation of state
- Ideal gas

** <2024-09-17 Tue> Equation of state 2


- Degenerate and non-relativistic gas
- Degenerate and relativistic gas
- Radiation-dominated

** <2024-09-19 Thu> Opacities


- opacity

** <2024-09-24 Tue> Radiative energy transport & conduction


** <2024-09-26 Thu> Convection


** <2024-10-01 Thu> Nuclear energy generation

*** Homework idea
 - compare structure of a star going through pp chain, CNO cycle, and
   a massive pop III star.

** <2024-10-03 Tue> Presentation expectations
 - Discuss what is expected for the presentations, how they will be
   graded, etc.
 - Discuss structure: introduce problem, show state-of-the-art
 - How to search for papers on [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/classic-form][NASA/ADS]]

** <2024-10-08 Thu> Radiative transfer, stellar atmospheres, and spectral lines

- line formation region
- line broadening mechanisms

** <2024-10-10 Tue> Evolution: low mass stars


** <2024-10-15 Thu> Evolution: high mass stars


** <2024-10-22 Tue> Supernovae
