* Lectures topic-by-topic
This is a rough schedule of the topics we will cover. However, we may
not get to all topics, depending on progress throughout the semester
and student interest. The order roughly follows the presentation in
[[https://www.astro.ru.nl/~onnop/][Onno Pols notes]].

** <2024-08-27 Tue> - Intro & orders of magnitude
*Aim*: Introduce the course, go over some quantities (M_{\odot}, R_{\odot},
L_{\odot}, stellar lifetimes)

[[./notes-lecture-Intro.org][Notes]]


** <2024-08-29 Thu> - Color-magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
*Aim*: Introduce color-magnitude diagrams, theoretical HR diagram, and
how they relate to each other. Review some black body radiation and
the basics of spectral formation to introduce spectral types.

[[./notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.org][Notes]]

** <2024-09-03 Tue> - Binaries and mass measurements
*Aim*: Introduce binaries as a common thing, list various types of
binaries (astrometric, visual, spectroscopic, eclipsing). Review
Kepler's laws and application to the mass determination in eclipsing
binary systems.

[[./notes-lecture-BIN.org][Notes]]

** <2024-09-05 Thu> - Hydrostatic equilibrium
*Aim*: Introduce the mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium
equations of stellar evolution. Introduce the assumption of spherical
symmetry. Time permitting, brief showcasing of [[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-submit][MESA-web]].

[[./notes-lecture-HSE.org][Notes]]

** <2024-09-10 Thu> - Equation of state 1
*Aim*: Introduce Polytropic and ideal gas equation of state.

[[./notes-lecture-EOS1.org][Notes]]

** <2024-09-12 Tue> - Virial theorem
*Aim*: Introduce the Virial theorem in various forms. Demonstrate that
stars "heat up as they lose energy".

[[./notes-lecture-VirTheo.org][Notes]]

** <2024-09-17 Tue> - Equation of state 2
*Aim*: Introduce other relevant equations of state
- Radiation-dominated
- Degenerate and non-relativistic gas
- Degenerate and relativistic gas

[[./notes-lecture-EOS2.org][Notes]]

*** Homework
Derive Chandrasekhar mass?

** <2024-09-19 Tue> - Radiative energy transport & conduction
*Aim*: Energy transport in radiative layers and the third stellar
structure equation for non-polytropic models

** <2024-09-24 Thu> - Opacities
*Aim*: Discuss the main source of opacities, Eddington limit and
modified Eddington limit


** <2024-09-26 Thu> - Convection
*Aim*: Introduce convective instability, mixing length theory and its
limitations.

[[https://www.as.arizona.edu/~mrenzo/materials/Convection.pdf][Notes (preliminary)]]


** <2024-10-01 Thu> - Nuclear energy generation
*Aim*: Introduce basics of nuclear energy generation through fusion,
recall basic quantum mechanics elements, Gamow peak
*** Homework idea
 - compare structure of a star going through pp chain, CNO cycle, and
   a massive pop III star.

*Aim*: introduce nuclear energy generation and nuclear timescale

[[file:materials/nuclear_reaction_rates.pdf][Notes (preliminary)]]


** <2024-10-03 Tue> - Introduction to stellar evolution codes
*Aim*: Introduce stellar evolution codes principles, MESA and MESA-web


** <2024-10-08 Tue> - Homology relations

** <2024-10-10 Tue> - Presentation expectations
*Aim*: Discuss what is expected for the presentations, how they will be
graded, etc.
 - Discuss structure: introduce problem, show state-of-the-art
 - How to search for papers on [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/classic-form][NASA/ADS]]

** <2024-10-15 Thu> - Radiative transfer
