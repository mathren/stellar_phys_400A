* Lectures topic-by-topic
This is a rough schedule of the topics we will cover. However, we may
not get to all topics, depending on progress throughout the semester
and student interests. The order roughly follows the presentation in
[[https://www.astro.ru.nl/~onnop/][Onno Pols notes]], but it is subject to changes as the course progresses.

** <2025-01-16 Thu> - Intro & orders of magnitude
*Aim*:
 - Discuss [[./syllabus.org][syllabus]] and learning outcomes
 - Go over some basics (magnitudes, parallaxes, solar quantities: M_{\odot}, R_{\odot}, L_{\odot}, stellar lifetimes)
 - Discuss project, show list
 - Discuss expectations and grading rubrics for course and project

[[./notes-lecture-Intro.org][Notes]]

** <2025-01-21 Tue> - Color-magnitude and Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
*Aim*: Introduce color-magnitude diagrams, theoretical HR diagram, and
how they relate to each other. Review some black body radiation and
the basics of spectral formation to introduce spectral types.

[[./notes-lecture-CMD-HRD.org][Notes]]

** <2025-01-23 Thu> - Binaries and mass measurements
*Aim*: Introduce the concept of binarity of stars as /not/ something
exotic. Walk through some classes of binaries based on how we observe them
(astrometric, visual, spectroscopic, eclipsing) and how they can be
used for empirical mass determination.

[[./notes-lecture-BIN.org][Notes]]

** <2025-01-28 Tue> - Hydrostatic equilibrium
*Aim*: Introduce the mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium
equations of stellar evolution. Re-discuss the assumption of spherical
symmetry. Introduce the dynamical timescale(s). Brief introduction to
[[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-submit][MESA-web]].

[[./notes-lecture-HSE.org][Notes]]

** <2025-01-30 Thu> - Equation of state 1
*Aim*: Introduce Polytropic and ideal gas equation of state.

[[./notes-lecture-EOS1.org][Notes]]

** <2025-02-04 Tue> - Virial theorem
*Aim*: Introduce the Virial theorem in various forms. Demonstrate that
stars "heat up as they lose energy".

[[./notes-lecture-VirTheo.org][Notes]]

** <2025-02-06 Thu> - Equation of state 2
*Aim*: Introduce other relevant equations of state
- Degenerate and non-relativistic gas
- Degenerate and relativistic gas
- Radiation-dominated EOS

[[./notes-lecture-EOS2.org][Notes]]

** <2025-02-11 Tue> - Radiative energy transport & conduction
*Aim*: Energy transport in radiative layers and the third stellar
structure equation for non-polytropic models, and local energy
conservation

[[./notes-lecture-ETransport.org][Notes]]

** <2025-02-13 Thu> - Opacities
*Aim*: discuss opacity, Rosseland mean opacities, atomic physics and other
sources of opacity in a star

[[./notes-lecture-kappa.org][Notes]]

** <2025-02-18 Tue> - Convection
*Aim*: Introduce convective instability, mixing length theory, and its
limitations.

[[./notes-lecture-convection.org][Notes]]

** <2025-02-20 Thu> - Nuclear energy generation
*Aim*: Introduce basics of nuclear energy generation through fusion,
recall basic quantum mechanics elements, Gamow peak.

[[./notes-lecture-nuclear-burning.org][Notes]]

** <2025-02-25 Tue> - Nuclear reaction chains

phases.

[[./notes-lecture-nuclear-cycles.org][Notes]]

** <2025-02-27 Thu> - Neutrino cooling + stellar evolution codes
*Aim*: discuss neutrino physics relevant to stars, cooling processes and
thus complete the physics needed for 1D stellar evolution calculation.
Introduce general principles of stellar structure and evolution codes
and population synthesis.
