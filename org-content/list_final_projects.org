* Project/presentation

*This part is worth 50% of your final grade, so you want to do it well!*

** Instructions
Each student will pick a topic to research based on textbooks, journal
articles, etc. from the list below and provide a short written summary
(\le 3 pages) and an oral presentation to the classroom. This will allow
each student to dig a bit deeper into a topic we cannot spend too much
time in class, and at the same time everyone can learn from each
other.

*The text has to be submitted one lecture before the presentation is
scheduled*, and the *presentation is 10min+5min questions*.

Both text and presentations will be evaluated by the instructors and
your peers according to a rubric outlined below.

Specifically, the text will be evaluated by a selected subgroup of
students, while the presentation and handling of the questions will be
evaluated by all the students present.

The way you provide evaluation and feedback to your peers will also be
considered for your final grading. Remember to appreciate the time and
effort others have put in their work and be kind and constructive in
providing feedback. The aim is to learn and improve, not to crush
other's work. And also, nothing is ever perfect, there is always
something that can be improved!
