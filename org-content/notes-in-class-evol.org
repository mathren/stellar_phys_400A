* In class activity: evolution of stars

** Aims
In this class activity, you will work together in groups of three to
piece together all the things we have learned so far and describe the
evolution of single, non-rotating stars with /your/ =MESA-web= models!

The aim is for you to be able to:
 1. *distinguish physical features from numerical artifacts*
 2. give a physical explanation for the features of the evolution of the star
    (e.g., on the HR diagram), based on the interior structure and evolution
 3. appreciate the timescales corresponding to the various features
 4. being able to describe and explain the qualitative differences
    between stars of different masses (and maybe even metallicity!)

This is often what we do with stellar models in research: we setup a
numerical experiment on the computer (in this case a crowdsourced grid
of many masses across the class), and then look at the results with a
copious dose of healthy skepticism and trying to filter out the
numerical artifacts from physical features of the models to build
understanding!

** Task 0: mass-luminosity relation revisited with models
We have already discussed /empirical/ L \equiv L(M) relations based on
/dynamical/ mass measurements in SB2 eclipsing binaries, and you have
derived an analytic relation for fully radiative stars. Let's now see
if our models agree and if we can understand why if they don't!

Find the "beginning of the main sequence" of your star, as in the
point where gravothermal equilibrium is achieved and L_{nuc} = L thanks
to hydrogen core burning and report on [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17HdroCGDeq5wl5l60erJ_-Vstz5JTujuxsz1BQhns0M/edit?gid=0#gid=0][this spreadsheet]] your mass and
luminosity at that point.

*Hint*: A very simple approximate criterion we can adopt here is
=center_h1= <= 99% =center_h1= at the beginning of the evolution. You can
find this in your =trimmed_history.data= in which every line contains a
timestep.

** Brief description of pgstar movies created by =MESA-web=
Since you downloaded your models from [[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-submit][MESA-web]], it makes sense to
start trying to understand your model using the =*.mp4= movie it
produces for you.

There is a lot going on here! Below I describe the panels in the
movies produced by =MESA-web=. Note the clock for physical time on the
very top left, and the number of timestep marked on the top right.

*N.B.:* if you set up a full blown MESA installation you can customize
/all/ of this!

*N.B.:* large excursions on a plot can take a very short physical time
(but a long computational time and many timesteps), viceversa
long-duration phases may take few large timesteps and /not/ produce
large variations on these plots!

*** Top right panel: abundance panel
This shows log_{10}(X_{i}) with X_{i} the mass fraction of the i-th isotope as
a function of mass coordinate.

*** Bottom right panel: HR diagram
Showing absolute bolometric luminosity vs. effective temperature

*** Middle top panel: Kippenhahn diagram
This shows the internal mixing processes and the energy generation as
a function of "time" (on the x-axis) and mass coordinate (y-axis):
each vertical line is effectively a snapshot at fixed time, the bottom
is the center, and the top is the surface.

Light blue indicates regions of the star where there is convection,
purple indicates thermohaline mixing, gray (if any) indicates
semiconvection. Red regions (which /can/ be hidden behind the mixing)
indicate \varepsilon_{nuc}>0, dark blue region indicate regions of strong neutrino
cooling (\varepsilon_{\nu} \ge \varepsilon_{nuc}). Some lines plotting M_{tot}, and mass
of the Helium, CO etc. cores may also be ploted.

The x-axis here is actually the timestep number. *N.B.:* \Delta t_{n} can
vary a lot with n, so this is not a linear mapping between physical
time and timestep number!

*** Middle bottom panel: T(\rho)
Annotated log-log plot of the temperature and density. The line color
indicates mixing at that location in the star, the yellow/orange/red
outline indicates the level of energy generation.

The annotations behind indicate regions of \Gamma<4/3 (\Rightarrow dynamical
instability), full degeneracy (\Rightarrow \varepsilon_{Fermi}\simeq 4 K_{B}T), and T(\rho)
lines corresponding to the ignition of various fuels.

*** Right panel: various profiles
These three panels show P, \rho, and T as a function of mass coordinate.


** Discuss with your "mass" group
Compare your model to the models of people nearby you and explore the
data you have. You probably want to start from the movie =MESA-web=
provides. Likely, you will need to play the movie over and over,
pausing it, and trying to correlate what happens in the various panels
to build physical understanding. If needed, you can also make more
plots (of =trimmed_history.data= and any =profile*.data= file available,
remember the python module available to read the data: [[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/resource/tools/mesa-web/mesa_web.py][mesa_web.py]]).

*N.B.:* See also the [[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-output][output description]] on the =MESA-web= site.

Pay attention to:
 - timescales /and/ timestep size
 - HR diagram
 - behavior on the T(\rho) diagram
 - composition (at surface and core)
 - Kippenhahn diagram

*** Some guiding questions for inspiration
1. where does the evolution start?
2. what is the energy source providing the luminosity L before
   significant nuclear burning occurs?
3. when does (significant) nuclear burning start? How long between the
   start of the run and the beginning of nuclear burning (in physical time)?
4. where does H run out in the core? How long does the H-core burning
   main sequence last?
5. what is the /structure/ of the star during H core burning (core vs.
   envelope). and why?
6. can you physically explain the behavior of L, R, and T_{eff} during
   the hydrogen core burning main sequence phase?
7. can you explain the morphology of the end of the H-core burning
   main sequence?
8. where does He core burning start?
9. is there any other nuclear burning during He core burning? And before?

* Wrap-up: Hayashi track and main sequence evolution

** Pre-main sequence and Hayashi track
We have developed a set of 4 non-linear, coupled ODEs to describe the
/structure/ and /evolution/ of stars (with physical approximations
built-in), with an EOS for closure conditions plus a set of equations
that describe the changes in composition due to nuclear processing and
mixing (see for example [[./notes-lecture-neutrinos.org::*Summary of equations we have derived][this summary]]).

We have also worked out the ordering of timescales of the problem:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\tau_\mathrm{nuc} \gg \tau_\mathrm{KH} \gg \tau_\mathrm{free\ fall} \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
which implies that for a star in hydrostatic equilibrium and LTE at
every location throughout the star (i.e., global gravothermal
equilibrium), the equations describing the (slow) /evolution/ of the
composition decouple from the 4 ODEs+EOS that describe the /structure/ of
the star.

The =MESA_web= stellar models that you have been looking at start at the
/top right/ of the Herzsprung-Russell diagram (so high L low T_{eff}) as a
uniform sphere of gas with set composition that is in hydrostatic but
not thermal equilibrium. These models thus evolve on a thermal
timescale \sim\tau_{KH} losing energy (L goes down) and contracting -- picture
lines of constant R=(L/(4\pi\sigma T_{eff}^{4)}))^{1/2}! This /is/ the gravothermal KH
contraction which leads to the increase in average \langle T \rangle by the virial
theorem, and it goes on until either:
1. *degeneracy pressure stops this process by changing the EOS, tapping
   into quantum mechanical effects to provide extra pressure*: this
   should not happen to any of your models, but it is how you form a
   *Brown Dwarfs* (BD) and a planets. The distinction between these is
   whether some minor nuclear burning, energetically unimportant but
   still affecting the composition happens before the object sets on
   gravothermal equilibrium: BD experience deuterium burning, but
   deuterium is a loosely bound nucleus and its burning doesn't release
   a lot of energy.
2. *an energy source (namely nuclear burning) stops the collapse*. This
   is what happens to your stars, where H burning (as the lightest and
   most energy-releasing fuel) starts. The point where L=L_{nuc} because
   of H core burning is referred to as *Zero Age Main Sequence* (ZAMS),
   since the "main sequence" of the color magnitude diagram containing
   most stars is made of stars during their longest phase of evolution,
   hydrogen core burning.

From the ignition of H in the core onwards, for timescales \tau \ll \tau_{nuc},
once the composition is decided (i.e., for fixed mass fractions {X_{i}})
the structure is determined by those 4 ODEs+EOS. This means that the
/initial/ structure of the star is /not/ sensitive to the (complex,
not-yet-fully understood) star formation process, and the ZAMS
structure is fully determined by the composition!

*** Pre-main sequence stellar structure

If the gravothermal collapse of the mass of gas considered ends with
the ignition of nuclear fuel (option 2. above), that is, if we make a
star (recall \langle T \rangle \prop \mu M/R, so the mass determines whether we get
here), then the phase from the beginning of the simulation until ZAMS
is called /pre-main-sequence/ (pre-MS).

During this phase the models start from the top-right of the diagram
at high L, large R (\Rightarrow low \langle T \rangle), and contract progressively contract
and heat up. This is an idealization: often as stars are doing that,
they still accrete mass, in the most massive stars (which have shorter
KH timescales and pre-MS phases), accretion may not be over until even
after ZAMS!

The \langle T \rangle is initially low (the gas that is collapsing is coming from
the ISM), and increasing. Since \nabla = \partial ln(T)/\partial ln(P) \propto \kappa L and \kappa
generally increases at low T, initially the stars have steep
temperature gradient and are /fully convective/! This homogenizes their
composition (but deuterium burning during the pre-MS can change this),
and also determines that \nabla\simeq\nabla_{ad} to very good approximation.

Since almost arbitrarily high energy flux can be carried by
(efficient) convection maintaining an adiabatic gradient, this means
the luminosity of a fully convective star does not depend much on its
structure (unlike a stably stratified /radiative/ star where the
temperature gradient of the /structure/ is determined by the need of
carrying the flux out).

This leads to the evolution of these stars along an almost vertical
initial path on the HR diagram, the so-called /Hayashi track/ (see also
Sec. 9.1.1. of Onno Pols' lecture notes for an analytic
approximation). The Hayashi track corresponds to solutions for fully
convective stars. Wiggles around this vertical line are due to
recombination and partial ionization zones leading to deviations of
the temperature gradient \nabla from adiabatic.

The Hayashi line effectively determines a right, low-T_{eff} boundary on
the HRD for stars in hydrostatic equilibrium: if a star were to be
colder, it would have a steeper-than-adiabatic gradient somewhere and
a lower opacity \kappa, thus radiation would escape more easily, meaning L
would increase, moving the star upwards back onto the Hayashi track.

*N.B.:* for these cool temperatures, we already know that the opacity is
dominated by H^{-}, molecules, and dust, and we have approximate powerlaw
scalings with T_{eff} (cf. [[./notes-lecture-kappa.org][opacity lecture]] and references therein).

The location in T_{eff} of the Hayashi track is dependent on the mass M
of the star: more massive stars are hotter since the very beginning.
This can be analytically derived imposing \nabla=\nabla_{ad} and solving the
remaining 3 EOSs assuming some form for \kappa\equiv\kappa(T,\rho) at the photosphere:
effectively the outer boundary condition and atmospheric physics
determine this.

Stars to the right, hotter side of the Hayashi track instead must not
be /fully convective/ and have some radiative layers.

** Main sequence

As the gravothermal collapse continues and \langle T \rangle increases, at some
point, if we are making a star, by /definition/ nuclear burning turns on
(option 2. above). This is when the central temperature (which at this
stage is the highest temperature in the star), is sufficient to obtain
enough tunneling through the Coulomb barriers.

Because it is abundant, and its burning releases a lot of energy per
nucleon (\sim 6.5MeV/nucleon) because it produces the double-magic
nucleus $^{4}$He \equiv \alpha (neutrons /and/ protons fill their nuclear "shells",
by analogy with electron shells in atomic physics), hydrogen is the
first fuel to ignite.

*** Structure during the main sequence
As we discussed in the [[./notes-lecture-nuclear-cycles.org][nuclear reaction cycles lecture]], hydrogen
burning can occur in two different ways: pp-cycle and CN-NO bi-cycle.

Looking at =MESA-web= models, we can see that the pp-cycle is sufficient
to achieve the equilibrium condition L_{nuc}=\int dm \varepsilon_{nuc}
\equiv L in low mass stars (*N.B.:* L\prop M^{x} with x>1). This is because the
pp-cycle has lower Coulomb barriers (shallower relation between \varepsilon_{nuc}
and T) but a higher normalization (cf. [[file:notes-lecture-nuclear-cycles.org::*pp \rightarrow CNO transition][pp \rightarrow CNO transition]]).

For the lowest-mass stars, T_{eff} remains cold and the opacity remains
high: they burn through the pp cycle, but remain /convective/ throughout
the main sequence. In this case, /all/ of the stellar material is
available to burn, there is no core/envelope structure at all! These
stars however have (relatively speaking) very low L, thus they evolve
very slowly. All these stars are still on the main-sequence! This is
the case of the 0.3M_{\odot} star you computed for a homework, which has
an approximately polytropic EOS because it is fully convective, thus
has \nabla=\nabla_{ad} \Rightarrow P\propto\rho^{\Gamma_{1}}.

- *Very low M main sequence \Rightarrow fully convective*

Moving slightly higher in mass, meaning also to higher T_{eff}, a
radiative core appears. the burning is very concentrated in the
innermost region, but they are cool enough to have high \kappa at the
surface, and thus retain a convective /envelope/:

- *Low M main sequence \Rightarrow radiative core, convective envelope*


*N.B.:* we are seeing that the cooler T_{eff} is the deeper the convective
envelope! Increasing T_{eff} the convective layer disappear in the
deepest layers.

Increasing M \Leftrightarrow T_{eff} further, the equilibrium condition L=L_{nuc} cannot
be satisfied anymore with the pp-chain, and the CN-NO bi-cycle kicks
in. Because of its higher Coulomb barriers, it has a steeper
temperature dependence: the energy release is even more concentrated,
implying that \nabla in the core is very steep (recall \nabla\prop \kappa L \prop \kappa L_{nuc}),
thus /the core becomes convective/. This means that convective mixing
makes a larger mass of hydrogen available to the very central burning
zone. At the same time, higher M \rightarrow higher T_{eff} and the envelope
becomes radiative

- *High M main sequence \Rightarrow convective core, radiative envelope*

#+CAPTION: The "initial" gravothermal equilibrium structure of a star is determined only by mass M and composition. The figure (Fig. 9.8 in Onno Pols' notes, modified from Kippenhahn & Weigert) shows in gray the region in mass coordinate y=m that are convective as a function of the total mass M=\int dm for Z=0.02 models. Red lines indicate where 50 and 90 % of the luminosity L is generated (the "burning region") and the blue dashed lines show r(m)=0.25M and r(m)=0.5M.

*** Evolution during the main sequence
During the main sequence L steadily increases on \tau\sim\tau_{nuc}. This is
because the conversion of hydrogen into helium decreases X, which
enters in two key quantities, mean molecular weight and electron
scattering opacity:
#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\mu \simeq \frac{1}{2X+\frac{3}{4}Y+\frac{Z}{2} \ \ , \\
\kappa \simeq \kappa_\mathrm{es} = 0.2(1+X) \ \ \mathrm{cm^{2}\ g^{-1}^{}} \ \ \ .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex


- core recession and L increase L\propto\mu^{4}M^{x}


*** End of the main sequence

**** "Low" mass

Very low mass stars smoothly evolve off the main sequence: if you look
at the T(\rho) diagram in the movie produced by =MESA-web=, from the
outlines of the track you can see where the nuclear burning moves.

#+CAPTION: Screenshot of a =MESA-web= calculation of a 1M_{\odot} star shortly after the main sequence. The HRD (bottom left) shows a smooth end of the main sequence, and the Kippenhahn diagram and T(\rho) tracks (middle) show that all the burning is in a shell surrouding the inert He core. The bottom right panel shows that the inner region as a flattening T profile because of conduction efficiently transporting energy and erasing the dT/dr.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[./images/1Msun_TAMS.png]]

Since these are stars that were burning radiatively (the fully
convective ones have not yet finished their main sequence even if they
had been burning since the birth of the Universe!), they have just
outside the region hot enough for hydrogen burning fresh fuel
available that has not been mixed in the burning region. Therefore,
*hydrogen ignites in a shell* around the now H-depleted, He-rich core.

Because of the gap in T to bridge the Coulomb barriers for
hydrogen-burning and 3\alpha, Helium core burning does /not/ ignite
immediately: the Helium core sits inert, contracts, degeneracy
pressure starts to matter and conduction becomes important, leading to
an almost /isothermal/ He core sitting below the H shell.

The morphology of the end of the main sequence for low mass stars with
radiative cores is /smooth/: the core contracts, the shell above it
contracts and it is immediately hot enough to burn. The temperature of
the shell is determined by the /contraction/ of the inert He core,
rather than by the energy generation by nuclear physics. Therefore,
the shell is typically becoming hot enough to burn through the CNO
cycle even for a low mass star.


**** "High" mass

Increasing the mass above the threshold for activating the CN-NO
bi-cycle (somewhere \sim1.1-1.3M_{\odot} depending on assumptions), the
morphology of the end of the main sequence changes.

#+CAPTION: Screenshot of a =MESA-web= calculation of a 30M_{\odot} star shortly after the main sequence. The HRD (bottom left) shows the "Henyey hook" feature, the Kippenhahn diagran and T(\rho) track shows that there is an off-center H-burning shell but the He in the core ignites promptly too. The core is not degenerate, but convective again, and mantains a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient.

:Question:
- *Q*: for your =MESA-web= models, what is the highest mass with a
  radiative main sequence core, and the lowest with convective main
  sequence core?
:end:

In this case, during the main sequence the /burning/ is even more
centralized in mass and radius coordinate than for lower-mass
pp-chain-sustained stars, but that drives /convection/. Therefore,
convective mixing refuels the burning region from a larger reservoir,
and when the fuel runs out, it means that there is a gap in the star
between where T is hot enough for nuclear reactions and where viable
fuel is. This causes an "overall contraction phase", also known as
"Henyey hook", where the star, out of energy sources resumes its
gravothermal collapse and shrinks in radius.

This process increases the temperature profile until the H-rich fuel
left at the edge of the convective core ignites in a shell. However,
the He core below, whose mass is set by the extent of convection
(+convective boundary mixing) during the main sequence, is too big to
be sustained by electron degeneracy pressure and too hot to be
degenerate (recall that \langle T \rangle \prop \mu M/R): below the shell the
contraction continues until He also promptly ignites!
