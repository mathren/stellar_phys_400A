** Brief description of pgstar movies created by =MESA-web=
Since you downloaded your models from [[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-submit][MESA-web]], it makes sense to
start trying to understand your model using the =*.mp4= movie it
produces for you.

There is a lot going on here! You probably will need to play the movie
over and over and try to correlate what happens in the various panels
to build physical understanding. If needed, you can also make more
plots (of =trimmed_history.data= and any =profile*.data= file available,
remember the python module available to read the data: [[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/resource/tools/mesa-web/mesa_web.py][mesa_web.py]])

Below I describe the panels in the movies produced by =MESA-web=. Note
the clock for physical time on the very top left, and the number of
timestep marked on the top right.

*N.B.:* if you set up a full blown MESA installation you can customize
/all/ of this!

*** Top right panel: abundance panel
This shows log_{10}(X_{i}) with X_{i} the mass fraction of the i-th isotope as
a function of mass coordinate.

*** Bottom right panel: HR diagram
Showing absolute bolometric luminosity vs. effective temperature

*** Middle top panel: Kippenhahn diagram
This shows the internal mixing processes and the energy generation as
a function of "time" (on the x-axis) and mass coordinate (y-axis):
each vertical line is effectively a snapshot at fixed time, the bottom
is the center, and the top is the surface.

Light blue indicates regions of the star where there is convection,
purple indicates thermohaline mixing, gray (if any) indicates
semiconvection. Red regions (which /can/ be hidden behind the mixing)
indicate \varepsilon_{nuc}>0, dark blue region indicate regions of strong neutrino
cooling (\varepsilon_{\nu} \ge \varepsilon_{nuc}). Some lines plotting M_{tot}, and mass
of the Helium, CO etc. cores may also be ploted.

The x-axis here is actually the timestep number. *N.B.:* \Delta t_{n} can
vary a lot with n, so this is not a linear mapping between physical
time and timestep number!

*** Middle bottom panel: T(\rho)
Annotated log-log plot of the temperature and density. The line color
indicates mixing at that location in the star, the yellow/orange/red
outline indicates the level of energy generation.

The annotations behind indicate regions of \Gamma<4/3 (\Rightarrow dynamical
instability), full degeneracy (\Rightarrow \varepsilon_{Fermi}\simeq 4 K_{B}T), and T(\rho)
lines corresponding to the ignition of various fuels.

*** Right panel: various profiles
These three panels show P, \rho, and T as a function of mass coordinate.


** General questions.
To guide your investigation of the models:

  - explain the behavior on the Hertzsrpung-Russell diagram
  - consider the timescales for anything you observe
  - consider the internal composition and its changes
  - explain the T(\rho) diagram


** Low mass stars

  - Hayashi track
  - He Flash
  - AGB pulses
  - WD formation
  - Tip of RGB

** High mass stars

  - Winds
  - T(\rho) diagram
