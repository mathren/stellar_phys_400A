* In class activity: evolution of stars

** Aims
In this class activity, you will work together in groups of three to
piece together all the things we have learned so far and describe the
evolution of single, non-rotating stars with /your/ =MESA-web= models!

The aim if for you to be able to:
 1. distinguish physical features from numerical artifacts
 2. explain physically the features of the evolution of the star
    (e.g., on the HR diagram), based on the interior structure and evolution
 3. appreciate the timescales corresponding to the various features
 4. being able to describe and explain the qualitative differences
    between stars of different masses (and maybe even metallicity!)

This is often what we do with stellar models in research: we setup a
numerical experiment on the computer (in this case a grid of many
masses across the class), and then look at the results with some
healthy skepticism and trying to filter out the numerical artifacts
from physical features of the models to build understanding!

** Task 0: mass-luminosity relation revisited with models
We have already discussed /empirical/ L \equiv L(M) relations based on
/dynamical/ mass measurements in SB2 eclipsing binaries, and you have
derived an analytic relation for radiative stars. Let's now see if our
models agree and if we can understand why if they don't!

Find the "beginning of the main sequence" of your star, as in the
point where gravothermal equilibrium is achieved and L_{nuc} = L thanks
to hydrogen core burning and report on [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17HdroCGDeq5wl5l60erJ_-Vstz5JTujuxsz1BQhns0M/edit?gid=0#gid=0][this spreadsheet]] your mass and
luminosity at that point.

*Hint*: A very simple approximate criterion we can adopt here is
=center_h1= <= 99% =center_h1= at the beginning of the evolution.

** General questions.
To guide your investigation of the models:

  - where does the model start initially?
  - explain the behavior on the Hertzsrpung-Russell diagram: why does
    L decrease/increase when it does? What happens at each hook and
    turn?
  - Use the other diagrams to infer the physical cause of each feature
    you investigate
  - ask yourselves: is this feature I see physical or is it a
    numerical artifact?
  - consider the timescales for anything you observe
  - consider the internal composition and its changes

Compare your model to the models of people nearby you and explore the
data you have. You probably want to start from the movie =MESA-web=
provides. Likely, you will need to play the movie over and over,
pausing it, and trying to correlate what happens in the various panels
to build physical understanding. If needed, you can also make more
plots (of =trimmed_history.data= and any =profile*.data= file available,
remember the python module available to read the data: [[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/resource/tools/mesa-web/mesa_web.py][mesa_web.py]]).

*N.B.:* See also the [[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-output][output description]] on the =MESA-web= site.

** Brief description of pgstar movies created by =MESA-web=
Since you downloaded your models from [[http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-submit][MESA-web]], it makes sense to
start trying to understand your model using the =*.mp4= movie it
produces for you.

There is a lot going on here! Below I describe the panels in the
movies produced by =MESA-web=. Note the clock for physical time on the
very top left, and the number of timestep marked on the top right.

*N.B.:* if you set up a full blown MESA installation you can customize
/all/ of this!

*** Top right panel: abundance panel
This shows log_{10}(X_{i}) with X_{i} the mass fraction of the i-th isotope as
a function of mass coordinate.

*** Bottom right panel: HR diagram
Showing absolute bolometric luminosity vs. effective temperature

*** Middle top panel: Kippenhahn diagram
This shows the internal mixing processes and the energy generation as
a function of "time" (on the x-axis) and mass coordinate (y-axis):
each vertical line is effectively a snapshot at fixed time, the bottom
is the center, and the top is the surface.

Light blue indicates regions of the star where there is convection,
purple indicates thermohaline mixing, gray (if any) indicates
semiconvection. Red regions (which /can/ be hidden behind the mixing)
indicate \varepsilon_{nuc}>0, dark blue region indicate regions of strong neutrino
cooling (\varepsilon_{\nu} \ge \varepsilon_{nuc}). Some lines plotting M_{tot}, and mass
of the Helium, CO etc. cores may also be ploted.

The x-axis here is actually the timestep number. *N.B.:* \Delta t_{n} can
vary a lot with n, so this is not a linear mapping between physical
time and timestep number!

*** Middle bottom panel: T(\rho)
Annotated log-log plot of the temperature and density. The line color
indicates mixing at that location in the star, the yellow/orange/red
outline indicates the level of energy generation.

The annotations behind indicate regions of \Gamma<4/3 (\Rightarrow dynamical
instability), full degeneracy (\Rightarrow \varepsilon_{Fermi}\simeq 4 K_{B}T), and T(\rho)
lines corresponding to the ignition of various fuels.

*** Right panel: various profiles
These three panels show P, \rho, and T as a function of mass coordinate.
