* Virial theorem
*Materials*: Chapter 2 of Onno Pols' lecture notes, Chapter 3 of
Kippenhahn's book, Sec. 1.5 of "Tapestry of Modern Astrophysics" by S.
N. Shore.

/The virial theorem connects gravitational physics and thermodynamics/.
Because of this, it has profound implications for any collection of
self-gravitating particles large enough to apply statistical
mechanics/thermodynamical methods: a star, but also a (sufficiently
massive) cluster of stars!

** Complete derivation
Introduce the full form with the \ddot{I} term

** Derivation for hydrostatic equilibrium

** Derivation for binary orbits

* Homework

- Using the virial theorem find a relation between the average sound
speed in the star and the escape velocity
