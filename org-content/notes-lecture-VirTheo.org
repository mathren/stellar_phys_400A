N. Shore.

/The virial theorem connects gravitational physics and thermodynamics/.
Because of this, it has profound implications for any collection of
self-gravitating particles large enough to apply statistical
mechanics/thermodynamic methods: a star, but also a (sufficiently
massive) cluster of stars!

The etymology of the name comes from "vir" which is latin for
"forces".

** Complete derivation
Let's start with the most general derivation (see for example
Goldstein's classical mechanics book or Shore's Tapesty of Modern
Astrophysics Sec. 1.5). For a collection of particles with mass m_{i}, Netwon's second law states that
the change in their momentum is equal to the total force they are
subject to:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
 m_{i} \ddot{r_{i}} = F_{i} \ \, .
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

Note that here r_{i} and F_{i} are vector quantities. We take the
first-order spatial moment of this distribution, which means we take
the dot product of each term by the position of the particles and sum
over all the particles. Why? The reason is /to make something like the
net potential energy appear in the second term/:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i} m_{i}\ddot{r_{i}} \cdot r_{i} = \sum_{i} F_{i} \cdot r_{i}
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

The r.h.s. looks like a sum of work done by the total foce on each
particle: \sum_{i} F_{i} \cdot r_{i} \equiv W, but this by conservation of energy
has to be equal to the net potential energy available U.

The l.h.s. can be re-written using the chain rule for the second time
derivative:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i} m_{i}\ddot{r_{i}} \cdot r_{i}  = \sum_{i} \frac{1}{2} m_{i} \frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}}r^{2} - \sum_{i} m_{i} \cdot \dot{r_{i}}^{2}
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

And now we have on the right hand side (assuming the mass of the
particles to be constant) twice the second time derivative of the moment of
inertia I = \sum_{i} m_{i} r_{i}^{2} and twice the kinetic energy KE = \sum_{i }m_{i} v_{i}^{2}/2. So
putting the r.h.s. of this last equation in the first spatial moment
of Newton's second law we obtain:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
 2\mathrm{KE}+\mathrm{U} = \frac{1}{2}\ddot{I}
\end{equation}
#+end_latex

This is the most-general form of the Virial theorem derived by
Clausius. In general, in the virial theorem there is a second
derivative of the moment of inertia on the r.h.s., which is often
forgotten. We did not specify almost anything about the system (see
Goldstein for a momentum-based derivation where the assumption of
constant masses m_{i} of the particles implicit in the way we wrote
Newton's second law is not even needed).

So far, this general form doesn't give us much intuition on its
meaning. We have a relation between the kinetic energy of a collection
of particles, its potential energy, and the second time-derivative of
its moment of inertia. But in the frame of the center of mass of such
collection, the kinetic energy of the particles is a measure of their
thermal energy, and this is absolutely non-trivial: why would the
thermal energy know about the potential energy! This statement is
however very general and its implication for stellar structure and
evolution are profound.

** Derivation for binary orbits

As a demonstration for the generality of the virial theorem, we can
apply it to a collection of particle with only 2 particles subject
only to the gravitational force, that is a binary system of two
point-mass stars on a Keplerian orbit!

One can write the total energy of the binary as:

#+begin_latex
\begin{equation}
E_\mathrm{tot} = \mathrm{KE}_{1} + \mathrm{KE}_{2} + \mathrm{U} \equiv \mathrm{KE} + \mathrm{U} \equiv -\frac{GM_{1}M_{2}}{2a}  \ \ ,
\end{equation}
#+end_latex
where in the last term we are using Kepler's laws. The gravitational
potential energy is U = -GM_{1}M_{2}/a, thus making it explicit we obtain:
KE = |U|/2. Since Keplerian orbits in Newtonian gravity are stable,
this implies that the second (and first) time-derivative of the moment
of inertia of the orbit is zero, and thus this /is/ the virial theorem!
/Keplerian binary orbits are "virialized"/.

** Derivation for stars in hydrostatic equilibrium
Let's now re-derive the Virial theorem for a star. Let's assume a
continuous description of the stellar gas, hydrostatic equilibrium and
spherical symmetry, and write explicitly the forces acting on each
shell dr of gas (cf. Eq. \ref{eq:HSE} in [[file:notes-lecture-HSE.org::*Combining the two][the previous lecture]]):





* Homework

- Using the virial theorem find a relation between the average sound
  speed in the star and the escape velocity
- Using the virial theorem, demonstrate that if a binary loses
  instantaneously an amount of mass greater than half the total mass
  of the binary, \Delta M \ge (M_{1}+M_{2})/2, then the orbit is unbound.
