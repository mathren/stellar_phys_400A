* Theoretical Astrophysics - Stellar Evolution

Material developed for the =AST400A= course (one semester) at the Department of
Astronomy and Steward Observatory of the University of Arizona (Fall
semester 2024/Spring semester 2025).

* Technical details

The lecture notes are written as emacs =org= files available in
[[./org-content]] and exported to =html= (available [[https://www.as.arizona.edu/~mrenzo/courses/index.html][online here]], the output
of the export also relies on the =css= and =html= templates in
[[./html-content]]), and in =pdf= (compiled with =LaTeX=) for printing and
annotating before I give a lecture.

** How to build it?

The script =build.sh= is the main script to build the website. It first
checks if the flag =all= was passed as an argument, in which case it
will build all the =org= files, otherwise it will look for the =org=-files
that have been modified using =git diff= and only build those.

The script actually calls emacs to do the build (with =-Q= flag so the
process does not depend on my specific emacs configuration), which is
run by =build.sh= in =script= mode to run the =elisp= script =build-site.el=.

=build-site.el= checks for the =htmlize= and =ox-publish= packages, and
installs them locally if they are not available, then exports to =html=
the appropriate files (either all the =org= files or the ones modified
since the last commit) to the folder =html-content=, and hands back the
control to =build.sh=, which finishes things by pushing to this repo and
rsync the =html= files from the server where I host the website (this is
just because the server is very old and I cannot have a modern version
of emacs to build directly there).

* Log

Each semester's website is archived as a [[https://github.com/mathren/stellar_phys_400A/releases][release]]. The Fall 2024
semester corresponds to release v1.0.
